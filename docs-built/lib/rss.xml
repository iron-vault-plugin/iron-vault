#### About

Ash Barlowe is a great adventurer but also a rascal.
Copy<br><br>If you want more control over how your character sheet is rendered, you can choose to use sub-blocks instead of the big single-block character sheet. You can remove the main character sheet simply by deleting the block (the thing with the backticks).<br>The following sub-blocks are available, each corresponding to a section of the full character sheet:<br>
<br>iron-vault-character-info - name, callsign, description, XP earned, XP spent
<br>iron-vault-character-stats - your character stats (edge, heart, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-meters - your character meters (health, spirit, etc, as well as momentum)
<br>iron-vault-character-special-tracks - your special progress tracks (legacy tracks like quests, bonds, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-impacts - impacts/debilities (wounded, doomed, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-assets - asset cards for your current character assets and their filled-out fields.
<br>You could, for example, use this to add headings before each section, or do the following to put your legacy tracks and your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/post/learn-from-failures-in-starforged" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/post/learn-from-failures-in-starforged" target="_blank">Delve Failure track</a> in the same place:<br>### Special Tracks

```iron-vault-character-special-tracks
```
![[Failure]]
Copy<br>Will render the following:<br><img alt="special-tracks-example.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/special-tracks-example.png"><br><br>You can reference a character file in a character block if you want to, say, put character blocks in a Canvas card instead of embedding a note. To do this, simply put the name of the character or a path to its filename in the body of the block:<br>```iron-vault-character-stats

 <br>Truth blocks are used to render pickers for individual truths. When filled out and saved, they will insert the final truth text underneath themselves into the current file.<br><a data-href="Truths" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/entities/truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Truths</a> are a core Ironsworn/Starforged concept, and one of the first things you'll do when you start a campaign. You can easily generate a Truths file with all your current rulesets' truths by using the <a data-href="Generate Truths" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/generate-truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Generate Truths</a> command.<br>Truth blocks expect the name of the Truth they'll be dealing with as the first line in their bodies. A second optional line with the text inserted will set the Truth block to its "click to reset" state, and is usually automatically written when you click save on the block.<br>Resetting the Truth block will reset it to its initial state and insert an Old Truth: header underneath, to separate your previously-generated truth text from the new one, so it won't delete any text you had there before that you might want to keep or reference.<br>Truth blocks let you either pick your truth options from a dropdown, or click on a die icon to randomize them according to the rules' oracle table.<br>Once the Truth is generated, you are free to edit the Truth text any way you see fit: it's just regular text in the file!<br>You can also choose to split your truths between multiple files, by just putting the iron-vault-truth blocks into separate files.<br><br>The following file:<br>## Cataclysm
```iron-vault-truth

 <br>Assets in Ironsworn/Starforged are a core mechanic for building up a character's "class" and their "inventory", of sorts. It's a fairly open-ended system that allows for interesting combinations, and it's also the core progression system of the game, where you grow your character not by upgrading their stats, but by buying new assets with XP and upgrading ones you already have.<br>Iron Vault directly supports assets in a number of ways.<br><br>Assets in most places in Iron Vault are represented as asset cards. These cards are shown in a number of places, including popup windows and your character sheet. They are only editable in the character sheet itself; otherwise, they will be shown as a read-only example:<br>

  <br><br>You can add assets to your character two different ways:<br>
<br>Using the <a data-href="Add asset to character" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/add-asset-to-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Add asset to character</a> command.

<br>Both of these methods will add the asset directly to your character sheet.

<br>Use the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a> command.

You can also use these to roll oracle groups/Entities.
<br>Manually roll the oracle using whatever reference you have and your preferred dice roller, or physical dice, and record the results in your journal using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">`oracle`</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle-group`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle-group`" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle-group`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">`oracle-group`</a> <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> nodes.

 <br>Tracks are a core feature of both Ironsworn and Starforged, as well as their expansions, and most related games. They involve filling a bar of 10 boxes, with each box taking 4 ticks to fill. On certain conditions, one or more ticks are added, and depending on the kind of track, different things can be done with that.<br>There are two main types of track in these games, and Iron Vault supports both: Progress Tracks and Special Tracks. This document only describes the former. Special Tracks are handled through the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character Sheet</a><br>Progress Tracks describe progress towards a certain goal. There are several kinds of Progress Track, such as Connections, Vows, Combat, and Scene Challenge tracks. What they have in common is that they all have something called a "rank" (ranging from "Troublesome" to "Epic"), which determines how many ticks to add on every "progress step", and they all get filled until the player does a final "Progress Move", which determines the success or failure of the event in question, and whose action value is based on the number of boxes filled.<br>There are two features supporting Progress Tracks in Iron Vault: the <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Create a progress track</a> command, and <a data-href="Track Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/track-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Track Blocks</a>. You can use the command to create a new Progress Track entity file with all the necessary metadata in its frontmatter, as well as a Track Block. You can then add any more details you want to that file.<br><br>Write the Docs<br><br>

 <br>New releases of Iron Vault may change how it represents different information present in your vault. The two main reasons for this are:<br>
<br>Internal changes to how Iron Vault represents things: For example, if we changed how we store the data on your character sheet
<br>Changes to the version of Datasworn used by Iron Vault: As discussed in <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rulesets and Homebrew</a>, Iron Vault relies on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> for both the internal representation of Ironsworn components and for the underlying data itself. This means that when major changes occur in Datasworn, your vault may need to be updated. In particular, if Datasworn changes the IDs for existing content, those ID references in your character sheet, journals, and more will need to be updated.
<br>Whenever you open a vault with Iron Vault installed, Iron Vault will check your vault to determine if any migrations are needed. You can also trigger this check by running the "Check if vault data migration is needed" command.<br>Unmigrated vaults
Iron Vault is only designed to work with vaults compatible with the current release. Using Iron Vault commands on an unmigrated vault may have unpredictable results.
<br><br>When Iron Vault detects that your vault needs a migration, you will be prompted to generate a migration report:<br><img alt="Migration report prompt.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/migration-report-prompt.png" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>If you choose yes, the plugin will generate a preview <a data-href="#Migration report" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/about:blank#Migration_report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Migration report</a> which you can use to understand the changes it will make in your vault. If you are satisfied with the report, run the "Check if vault data migration is needed" command again and this time choose "no" for the report.<br>If you choose no, you will then see a new prompt, asking you if you wish to allow the migration:<br><img alt="Migration prompt.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/migration-prompt.png" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Back up your vault before attempting migration
You should make a back up of your vault before running a migration. We design the migrations carefully and test them before release, but, because they can rewrite all files in your vault, you should keep a backup to guard against a migration causing data loss.
<br>If you choose "yes", your vault will be migrated to the latest version. A <a data-href="#Migration report" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/about:blank#Migration_report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Migration report</a> will be generated so you can see what changes were actually made to your vault.<br><br>Migration reports detail the changes made (or, in the case of previews, the changes that would be made) in a migration. You can review a preview log before <br>
<img alt="Migration report.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/migration-report.png" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;">
<br>In this case, a Datasworn version change has changed the IDs used by various oracles, and the ids for these oracles are being updated to match the current version.]]></description><link>https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/data-versions-and-vault-migration.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Other Features/Data versions and vault migration.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 19:27:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/migration-report-prompt.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/migration-report-prompt.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Debug Logging]]></title><description><![CDATA[

There are various ways of defining and activating rulesets in Iron Vault.<br><br>Iron Vault relies on the official <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> library for two key elements:<br>
<br>A structure (also known as a schema) for representing as data the components of an Ironsworn-based game, such as the moves, assets, and oracles.
<br>Official data files using the Datasworn schema for Ironsworn, Ironsworn: Delve, Starforged, and Sundered Isles.
<br>In <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> parlance, a rules package can be either a base ruleset (such as Ironsworn or Starforged) or an expansion (such as Ironsworn: Delve) which adds additional content to a base ruleset.<br><br>Iron Vault is bundled with official <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> rulesets for Ironsworn and Starforged. You can control the active rulesets via <a data-href="Settings#Rulesets" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/settings.html#Rulesets" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Settings &gt; Rulesets</a>.<br>(Experimental)<br>Official support for expansions like Ironsworn: Delve and Sundered Isles is on the roadmap. Right now, we have experimental support for loading expansion content.

Please note: new mechanics introduced by the expansion may not be implemented fully or correctly at this time. The expansions do not standalone and you are expected to enable the appropriate base game along with the expansion. Iron Vault does not enforce this at this time, but things may not work correctly if you enable an expansion without enabling the appropriate base game.<br>Sundered Isles is in preview.
The Datasworn Sundered Isles data is considered a preview, awaiting finalization of the Sundered Isles rulebook.
<br><br>Iron Vault supports custom homebrew rules packages. In the future, we will add additional mechanisms for easily adding things like oracles, moves, and assets in simpler Markdown format.<br><br>Custom rules packages can be loaded from JSON files following the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> specification. Files must be in a format compatible with the Datasworn 0.1.0 release.

In settings, turn on Enable Homebrew content in Settings and set Homebrew content folder to the folder with your content.<br>Note that, in addition, you might need to enable Settings &gt; Files and links &gt; Detect all file extensions in order for .json files to show up in your vault.

 <br> Iron Vault includes various settings for tweaking the behavior of its features, to allow you to shape it into a better tool for your use case.<br><br>
<br>Use character system: when enabled, this will look for an active <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character</a> file when making moves and doing other game operations. If disabled, Iron Vault will still work, but will prompt you for values of, for example, your stats. This is a good setting to disable if you only wish to use a particular subset of Iron Vault features, like <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> or the <a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar</a> but don't really care to use the various <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Commands/index" data-href="Commands/index" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Commands</a>.
<br>Reset to default: returns all settings to their default values.
<br><br>You must load a single complete base ruleset for functionality like characters to function properly. It is currently possible to load multiple rulesets at once, but this may behave in unexpected ways.<br>For more on rulesets, see <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rulesets and Homebrew</a>.<br>
<br>Enable Ironsworn ruleset: when enabled, the Ironsworn base ruleset will be loaded.
<br>Enable Delve expansion for Ironsworn: (experimental) when enabled, the Ironsworn: Delve core ruleset will be loaded. This assumes Ironsworn is also enabled in order to work correctly.
<br>Enable Starforged ruleset: when enabled, the Starforged base ruleset will be loaded.
<br>Enable Sundered Isles expansion for Starforged: (experimental) If enabled, Sundered Isles content will be enabled. This assumes Starforged to also be enabled in order to work correctly. There is currently no way to "exclude" Starforged-themed content when Sundered Isles is enabled. You just get both.
<br><br>For more on homebrew, see <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew#Homebrew" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html#Homebrew" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rulesets and Homebrew &gt; Homebrew</a>.<br>
<br>Enable Homebrew content: when enabled, content from the folder below will be loaded and available for play.
<br>Homebrew content folder: a folder (which must exist if Enable Homebrew content is on) from which to load homebrew content. Currently all JSON files in Datasworn format in the root of this folder will be loaded.
<br><br>
<br>Prompt for rolls in Make a Move: if enabled, when you <a data-href="Make a move" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/make-a-move.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Make a move</a>, the plugin will prompt you to roll your own dice and enter the values.
<br>Prompt for rolls in Ask the Oracle: if enabled, when you <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a>, the plugin will prompt you to roll your own dice and enter the values.
<br>Cursed die kind: The type of die to roll when making cursed die rolls.
<br>Enable cursed die: If enabled, the cursed die will be rolled along with the oracle die when rolling an oracle with an associated cursed oracle table.
<br>Graphical dice: When enabled, 3d graphical dice will be rolled on-screen whenever a die roll is made.
<br>(x) die color: Sets the color of the various supported dice. Challenge dice may be colored separately in order to support Sundered Isles' Twin Fates feature (Cinder/Wraith).
<br><br>
<br>Default (x) folder: Controls which folder to put various rollable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/index" data-href="Entities/index" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/entities/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Entities</a> in by default. You can still pick the folder on an individual basis, or even move it, regardless of what these values are.
<br>(x) template file: If provided, the contents of these files will be added to the end of the new entity files when they're created. (Coming Soon) This will eventually be replaced with a more involved template system that will give you more control of how files are generated and formatted, and what additional frontmatter they include.
<br><br>These options control various parts of how <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> are rendered.<br>
<br>Collapse move blocks: when enabled  moves in mechanics blocks will only show the move name and result when first rendered, and you'll need to click on them in order to see move details.
<br>Show mechanics toggle: when enabled, mechanics blocks will have a small "Hide mechanics" toggle underneath them that, when clicked, will hide the mechanics block.
<br>Hide mechanics completely: If enabled, mechanics blocks will not be displayed at all. Good for when you just want to read a story. You can also toggle this setting by using the <a data-href="Toggle displaying mechanics" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/toggle-displaying-mechanics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Toggle displaying mechanics</a> command.
<br>Inline tracks on clock creation: If enabled, new tracks and clocks will be automatically inlined in the journal when created.

 <br>iIron Vault overrides a number of kinds of links to change their behavior: instead of trying to open a link in your browser, they will open a pop window/modal with the entity they link to.<br>You can use special links using external link syntax ([Name of Link](type:path/a/b)), where type:path/a/b is one of the following:<br>

<br>move:, oracle:, or asset: followed by the name of a move, oracle, or asset. The name must have no spaces, but you can capitalize it however you want. For example, [Face Danger](move:Facedanger).
<br>The following Datasworn entity types are clickable:<br><br>Clicking on a move link will open a popup window with move details.<br>Example: [Face Danger](move:FaceDanger) or [Face Danger](move:starforged/adventure/face_danger) will open a popup window that looks like this:<br><img alt="face-danger-link.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/face-danger-link.png"><br><br>Clicking an Oracle link will open a popup window with the Oracle move table.

Which means: Congratulations! You're already playing Starforged using Iron Vault!<br>To quickly address the first section on player safety: Iron Vault supports two safety mechanisms related to the safety strategies the Rulebook describes:<br>

<br><br>Before we start, we have to introduce a core concept to Iron Vault: journals.<br>Iron Vault has a lot of features to populate and manage your story journals. Many of its commands and actions actually record their results in a journal and render them in a nice way, so you can look back and see exactly what was happening with your mechanics, or tweak things as needed.<br>Since we're going to start interacting with these mechanics commands now, you should take a moment to create a "Journals" folder in your vault. Inside it, create a "Session 0" note and open it. We'll use this to record all our upcoming Ask the Oracle rolls:<br><img alt="session-0.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/session-0.png"><br>You can write anything you want here! Write about your thoughts so far on what you want out of your campaign, or what ideas you have for your character. Or just leave it blank for now, and we'll just use it as a scratch board for Oracle rolls.<br><br>From here on, we'll walk through the four main steps in the Starforged Getting Started section:<br>

Each <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Rulesets and Homebrew" data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ruleset</a> comes with its own set of Truths, which are themed to that game or expansion's default setting. Of course, you can always skip right by this and start writing about your world however you prefer, but using the Truths tool is very handy!<br><br>Iron Vault directly supports tools through something called <a data-href="Truth Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/truth-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Truth Blocks</a>. These are also the first type of block you'll be introduced to.<br>Iron Vault uses <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Blocks/index" data-href="Blocks/index" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Blocks</a> for many things, in order to draw special tools and interactive widgets on your notes for you that will help you during play.<br>All Blocks are created the same way: three backticks, a block name, a new line, and three more backticks. Sometimes, there can be something between the backticks. For example, this is what a Truth Block for the Cataclysm Truth looks like:<br>```iron-vault-truth
Cataclysm
```
Copy<br>When used in a note, it will render a widget that looks like this, and which you can click on to interact with:<br>
      
        
          
            Select your truth...
          
          
              
                The Sun Plague extinguished the stars in our home galaxy.
              
            
              
                Interdimensional entities invaded our reality.
              
            
              
                We escaped the ravages of a catastrophic war.
              
            
        
        
        
          
          
          
            
          
        
      
    <br>Having to write all these out can get tedious, though, so Iron Vault generally has commands or buttons that will generate them for you.<br><br>In our case, what we want is the <a data-href="Generate Truths" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/generate-truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Generate Truths</a> command. You can run it by either clicking on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="" target="_blank">Obsidian Ribbon</a> icon that looks like:  <img alt="ribbon-icon.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/ribbon-icon.png" style="width: 40px; max-width: 100%;">, then choosing "Generate Truths" from the menu that pops up. You can also use Ctrl+P (or Cmd+P on macOS) to open the Obsidian Command Palette and search for the "Generate Truths" command there.<br>When you call it, you'll get a menu like this:<br><img alt="generate-truths-menu.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/generate-truths-menu.png"><br>Go ahead and set the file name to "Truths" and leave Target Folder blank, then press "Create".<br>Iron Vault will then create a Truths file and prepopulate it with headers and <a data-href="Truth Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/truth-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Truth Blocks</a> for all of Starforge's default Truths. It'll look something like this:<br><img alt="generated-truths-page.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/generated-truths-page.png"><br>Now we can start picking our Truths!<br><br>At this point, you can go one by one and select your Truths.<br>The Starforged Rulebook gives you three options for choosing each Truth:<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Just choosing a Truth" data-href="#Just choosing a Truth" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/about:blank#Just_choosing_a_Truth" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Just choosing a Truth from the list</a>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Rolling for a Truth" data-href="#Rolling for a Truth" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/about:blank#Rolling_for_a_Truth" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rolling for a Truth using your oracle dice</a>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Customizing a Truth, or Crafting Your Own" data-href="#Customizing a Truth, or Crafting Your Own" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/about:blank#Customizing_a_Truth,_or_Crafting_Your_Own" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Customizing a Truth, or crafting your own</a>
<br>Iron Vault supports all three!<br>Once you've taken your chosen path, you'll be able to move on to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="04 - Create Your Character" data-href="04 - Create Your Character" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/player's-guide/getting-started/04-create-your-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Creating Your Character</a>.<br><br>Directly choosing a Truth is as simple as clicking on the Select your truth... dropdown in each Truth Block, and picking whichever you like best. You may need to repeat it if the Truth has sub-options.<br>When you're satisfied with your choice, press the save button on the bottom right to write the results to your note.<br><br>To randomize this process, you can click on the small die button next to the Select your truth... dropdown. This will pick a random Truth from the list of built-in ones. You may have to repeat this if the Truth has sub-options.<br>If you're satisfied with the results, press the save button on the bottom right to write the results to your note.<br><br>Truth notes are regular notes! You can actually write anything you want on this note, in any structure you want. If you want to reorder the Truths, you can just cut and paste the header and the Truth Block and move it wherever you want. Likewise, if you want to add or remove Truths, you can do that, although Truth Blocks will only work for Truths in your active <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rulesets and Homebrew</a>. But headers still work!<br>If you chose to pick or roll for a Truth, as above, you can also freely edit the results at any time to add more color, to change details, or otherwise update the Truth to your preference.<br>Eventually, you may even want to move your Truths into different notes, and all you have to do for that is to cut and paste the parts you want.<br><br>Did you press save, but you don't like the results and you want to try again? Just press the "Reset" button on the Truth Block, and it'll insert a separator before your current Truth text, and let you pick your Truth again!<br><br>Once you've taken your chosen path, you'll be able to move on to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="04 - Create Your Character" data-href="04 - Create Your Character" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/player's-guide/getting-started/04-create-your-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Creating Your Character</a>.]]></description><link>https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/player's-guide/getting-started/03-choose-your-truths.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Player's Guide/Getting Started/03 - Choose Your Truths.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 02:34:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/ribbon-icon.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/ribbon-icon.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[04 - Create Your Character]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Your character! Your character is the protagonist of your story. They are the vehicle through which you write and experience the story you're telling by playing these wonderful games.<br>As such, the process of creating your character is very important! In this guide, we'll walk you through the whole process, following along with the Starforged Rulebook's steps!<br><br>What's a hero without a character sheet?<br>Iron Vault has a concept of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character Entities</a>, and includes built-in <a data-href="Character Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/character-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character Blocks</a>. With these two building blocks, we can build a full-featured, flexible character sheet!<br>You can quickly generate a character sheet by running the <a data-href="Create new character" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/create-new-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Create new character</a> command (either through the Ribbon button or through Ctrl+P/Cmd+P). This will prompt you for a character name, but don't worry: you can fill this in later, you might just have to rename the file if that happens.<br>The first thing you'll notice, of course, is a long column of words and numbers and such on the top of the page:<br><img alt="character-frontmatter.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/character-frontmatter.png"><br>These are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties" target="_blank">Obsidian Properties</a>, otherwise referred to as the Frontmatter. In essence, this is where the "data" for your character is stored. The first thing you'll probably want to do is get it out of the way, though, so just click on "Properties" to collapse it.<br>Once you do that, you'll be greeted with a much nicer representation of that data, your character sheet, as rendered by <a data-href="Character Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/character-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character Blocks</a>:<br><img alt="character-sheet.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/character-sheet.png"><br>This character sheet is fully-editable and interactive, so you never have to manually edit Properties yourself, even if that's what it ends up writing to each time.<br><br>There's eleven steps for character creation in Starforged, and we'll be going over each one!<br>

<br><br>Assuming you haven't already been playing around with the shiny character sheet, this is your first interaction with it! Let's make it count.<br>The first step after sorting cards (which we don't have to do) is to pick two Path assets. We can do that one of two ways:<br>
<br>Run the <a data-href="Add asset to character" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/add-asset-to-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Add asset to character</a> command
<br>Clock on the "Add Asset" button at the bottom of your character sheet
<br>Whichever you choose, you'll be greeted by this popup window:<br><img alt="asset-picker-initial.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/asset-picker-initial.png"><br>
You can click on each asset category here to expand it. For example, we only care about Paths right now:<br><img alt="asset-picker-expanded.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/asset-picker-expanded.png"><br>Finally, you can expand again in order to see a nicely-rendered asset card for each asset, as well as a button that you can press to add it. You'll be able to edit the asset's fields after you add it:<br><img alt="asset-picker-card.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/asset-picker-card.png"><br>Go ahead and pick your two Paths. If you change your mind about a choice, simply click the "x" button on the asset card in your character sheet. If you want to reorder them, just drag and drop them by the top part.<br><br>Although you had some opportunity to do this with Truths, this is likely the first time you'll have to make a choice about where to put something and how to organize your vault. Your backstory can go anywhere you want, after all!<br>Some ideas:<br>
<br>Write it under a ## Backstory section at the bottom of your character sheet.
<br>Use the Session 0 note to start fleshing out a bit of background narrative and make it more story-like.
<br>Create a separate note, maybe in a separate folder like "Lore", where you can add snippets of backstory like this.
<br>Or anything else you can think up! As long as you write it somewhere in the vault, you'll be able to keep track of it and link to it pretty freely! I recommend making sure you put a header (##...) of some sort at the start of your backstory, though, to make it easier to link directly to it.<br>Want some help? You can <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a>! You can do this two ways:<br>
<br>Run the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a> command directly through the Command Palette/Ribbon button
<br>Use the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Iron Vault Sidebar Oracle Browser</a>
<br><br>As before, you can simply run the command, and you'll be greeted by a filterable oracle picker. Search for "Backstory Prompts" to find the table we're looking for, and select it. <br><br>Regardless of which method you pick, you'll be greeted with this popup window:<br><img alt="backstory-prompts-popup.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/backstory-prompts-popup.png"><br>
The roll will have been made immediately, but you can choose to reroll by clicking on the reroll icon, or select either the current roll, or the flipped (opposite) roll.<br>In my case, I decided to put my backstory details in my "Session 0" journal, so that's what I had open when I called this:<br><img alt="backstory-mechanics-block.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/backstory-mechanics-block.png"><br>
What's this? Well, that's a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Oracle Mechanics Block</a>. Iron Vault includes all sorts of mechanics blocks for all sorts of situations having to do with game mechanics, and it renders them all nicely for you! If you're curious, you can go ahead and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks" data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">read more about them here.</a> As you can see, I also wrote some extra color underneath to set the stage for the backstory in a more narrative way.<br><br>Next up: your background vow! We'll be creating our first progress track this time.<br>I'll start by rolling on the Character Goal Oracle to get an idea of what that might be. Then, I'll use the <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Create a progress track</a> command to create the vow itself.<br>Skipping over the Oracle roll, this is what the progress track popup window will look like:<br><img alt="background-vow-window.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/background-vow-window.png"><br>I've already filled in the fields with what makes sense for our particular vow, and when I press create, the following will be inserted into my Session 0 note:<br><img alt="background-vow-inserted.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/background-vow-inserted.png"><br><br>You're likely getting a sense of how to do things by now. Our next step is to set up our Starship. Let's start with an Oracle roll. In this case, I'll go click on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar's Oracle Tab</a> and search for "starship". Browsing around. I see that this Oracle is actually under "Campaign Launch Oracles":<br><img alt="sidebar-starship-history.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/sidebar-starship-history.png"><br>After rolling that, I can once again <a data-href="Add asset to character" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/add-asset-to-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Add asset to character</a> (or click on the "Add Asset" button on my character sheet), and pick the Starship from the list, making sure to give it a name!<br><img alt="starship-asset.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/starship-asset.png"><br><br>And just like above, we repeat that for our final asset. This time, you can pick anything except a Deed! So go ahead and do that.<br><br>You may have noticed that all your stats on your character sheet were actually set to "0". In this step, we'll go ahead and set them to what we want.<br>The standard spread for stats in Starforged and Ironsworn is 3 2 2 1 1. So we'll allocate those by just... clicking on each stat box and typing them in!<br><img alt="stats-edited.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/stats-edited.png"><br><br>Iron Vault will have already set your condition meters to their defaults, but if you want to make any adjustments, you can either click on the +/- buttons next to each value, or type the value you want by clicking on the numbers themselves.<br>Momentum reset will automatically be tracked for you based on your impacts.<br><img alt="condition-meters.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/condition-meters.png"><br><br>Let's picture in our minds what our character is like! This can really immerse you in your new character, and also give you clues about how they see the world and how the world sees them.<br>The Starforged Rulebook suggests defining one or two facts about how they look, how they act, and what they wear.<br>We have some options on where to put this, such as the bottom of the character sheet or in Session 0, but for this basic description, we'll just type these details in the "description" box in the character sheet itself:<br><img alt="character-description.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/character-description.png"><br><br>While we already named our character when we first created them, it's time to give them a callsign and some pronouns. We can, again, just fill these in directly on the character sheet, rolling an oracle for the callsign if we want (while on the Session 0 note):<br><img alt="callsign-pronouns.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/callsign-pronouns.png"><br><br>Our last step is to gear up!<br>The base assumption is that we all have a spacer kit with some basics in it. But we can also add a section to our character sheet with details about some other stuff we might be carrying around. For this, we can go to the bottom of our character sheet and just add another header:<br><img alt="gearing-up.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/gearing-up.png"><br><br>That was a lot!<br>But with all that done: congratulations!

 <br>Now that we have a character, the next step is to create our first sector. You can find the process for this on p. 114 of the Starforged Rulebook.<br>Generating your starting sector is a 10-step process, so expect it to take a while, and remember that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="01 - Initial Setup > Prep is Play" data-href="01 - Initial Setup#Prep is Play" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/player's-guide/getting-started/01-initial-setup.html#Prep_is_Play" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Prep is Play</a>!<br>Before we start, it's worth noting that this part of the guide involves a lot of suggestions on how to represent your sector and things in it. Remember that you're free to structure your campaign however you want! Obsidian is a very flexible tool. In the interest of not getting too deep in the weeds with what's out there, though, we've documented a "happy path" that you can get started with and transform into what's most ideal for you.

<br><a data-href="#Next steps" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/about:blank#Next_steps" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Next steps</a>
<br><br>For this example, we're going to use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md/canvas" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://obsidian.md/canvas" target="_blank">Obsidian Canvas</a> to represent regions. It's a very flexible tool that gives us all of the pieces we need to have an interesting and visually-appealing region that we can link to!<br>We start by running the "Create a canvas" command, or by clicking on the "Create new canvas" Ribbon button.<br>We also move that canvas into a "Locations/Sectors" folder in our vault, to keep things organized.<br>Don't worry about giving it a name for now: that's our last step!<br><img alt="sector-initial.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/sector-initial.png"><br>Once that's done, we can complete Step 1 by adding a new card to our Canvas that we'll use for basic sector details. You can turn this into a note later if you'd like, too.<br>Go ahead and make a card using the Canvas interface, then pick which region to start in. Iron Vault also includes an unofficial Region oracle that you can find under "Homebrew" in the sidebar, if you're having trouble deciding.<br><img alt="sector-region.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/sector-region.png"><br>Let's move on.<br><br>Once that's done, this step is simple: make note of how many settlements we'll need to generate based on what you picked for your starting region. The Rulebook gives the following suggestions, based on your sector's region:<br>
<br>Terminus: 4 settlements
<br>Outlands: 3 settlements
<br>Expands: 2 settlements
<br><br>Now it's time to generate the settlements themselves! For this, we switch back to our Session 0 journal, because we'll be rolling some oracles!<br>Iron Vault lets you roll multiple oracles at the same time by going to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar's Oracle Tab</a> and pressing the dice icon on any oracle group. Some of these oracle groups, though, have special semantics, and we call those rollable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/index" data-href="Entities/index" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/entities/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Entities</a>.<br>Generating an entity is easy: run the <a data-href="Generate an entity" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/generate-an-entity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Generate an entity</a> command, or click on the corresponding dice icon in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar</a> for the entity you want to roll. You'll see a list of supported entities pop up in a list. In our case, we want to generate a Settlement, so we pick that entity.<br><img alt="entity-type-picker.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/entity-type-picker.png"><br>The next prompt will ask you what region you want to generate this in, which you can optionally roll.<br><img alt="entity-region-picker.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/entity-region-picker.png"><br>Then, you'll get a popup that looks like this:<br><img alt="generate-entity-modal.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/generate-entity-modal.png"><br>This includes all oracles related to this entity that you might want to roll. The Rulebook, however, specifies only a subset of them for initial generation. We can roll only those oracles by clicking "Roll First Look":<br><img alt="generate-entity-modal-filled.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/generate-entity-modal-filled.png"><br>Make sure you have the Session 0 note open, then toggle on the "Create entity file" setting, and click accept. You'll end up with a new note in your vault, and a bunch of oracle rolls recorded in your Session 0 note, for future reference. While you're at it, move your new settlement into a "Locations/Settlements" folder in your vault:<br><img alt="first-settlement.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/first-settlement.png"><br>Go ahead and do this for the rest of the settlements you're supposed to generate, up to the recommended number, then we can move on.<br><br>Planets are also entities, so we can repeat this process for any settlements that are either planetside, or in orbit of a planet. This time, we'll move them to a "Locations/Planets" folder:<br><img alt="generated-planets.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/generated-planets.png"><br>If you don't like a name, or if you want to manually edit one of the generated fields, you can go ahead and edit the note for the planet itself (you can do this for settlements, too, of course).<br>The last step with planets is to associate them with the settlements we generated them for. This is a two step process: add a link from the planet to the settlement, then another from the settlement to the planet, for convenience. This part is optional but can be helpful!<br>To add these links, just open up your settlement and click on the right-hand column next to location, then type ([[NameOfPlanet]]) next to where the location is, and a link will be created, like so:<br><img alt="edited-settlement-planet.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/edited-settlement-planet.png"><br>And then we do the inverse in the Planet note:<br><img alt="edited-planet-settlement.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/edited-planet-settlement.png"><br>Repeat this for all your planet/settlement pairs, and we're done with this step!<br><br>This step is optional, but we may as well look at how to do it here, too. Generating a star doesn't even require entity generation: it's a simple oracle roll on the Stellar Object oracle:<br><img alt="stellar-object-oracle-rolls.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/stellar-object-oracle-rolls.png"><br>If you want, you can either create new notes for these and hash them out some more, give them names, etc. Or, if you want to keep it simple, just add a row to your planets' notes with the results of the oracle:<br><img alt="planet-with-star-row.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/planet-with-star-row.png"><br><br>Now that we have all our bits together, it's time to set up our sector map in more detail!<br>Go back to your sector Canvas from before. Then, add a new note to the Canvas with all of your elements and arrange them how you'd like. I like putting planets and settlements in a Canvas Group named after either the planet or the star so I can drag them around together while having them both right on the map:<br><img alt="sector-with-stuff.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/sector-with-stuff.png"><br>There's a lot more you could do here to gussy it up, but as the Rulebook says, I like to keep it simple. I can make it fancier later!<br>For a more in-depth guide to working with the Canvas, see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas" target="_blank">its official documentation</a>.<br><br>Now that we have things on our map, let's connect them!<br>Obsidian Canvas supports connecting nodes with edges, just like what we need to do our passages! To create an edge, first hover over one of the sides of your nodes. You'll see a small circle pop up right in the middle. If you grab this circle, you can drag a line all the way to another node or node group, and it will connect them! I like to also change the arrow type to "nondirectional", and give them a color. Sometimes I color code them based on what kind of journey it is, but that's up to you.<br><img alt="sector-with-passages.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/sector-with-passages.png"><br><br>Once you have everything set up, it's time to pick one settlement you'd like to zoom into. First, we'll go back to our section for settlements and add a new sub-header: #### Zooming in: [[NameOfSettlement]]Then, we'll use the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a> command, or search in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar</a> for "settlement oracles".<br>The Rulebook suggests we roll the following, so we'll do that:<br>
<br>First Look (1-2 times)
<br>Settlement Trouble
<br>Once you have those in your Session 0 journal, you can simply copy/paste them to the corresponding table for your settlement in that settlement's note!<br><img alt="zoomed-in-settlement.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/zoomed-in-settlement.png"><br><br>For this, we don't have to <a data-href="Make a move" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/make-a-move.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Make a move</a>, since we're supposed to assume an automatic strong hit, so we'll just do the next step: <a data-href="Generate an entity" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/generate-an-entity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Generate an entity</a> and picking "Character". Following the same process as with Planets and Settlements, make sure you've checked "Create entity file". For this, you might also want to click on the dice icon to roll for a Character Role, and then click Accept.<br>For NPCs, I like to make an "NPCs" folder in my vault, then I can move my new connection in there:<br><img alt="generated-connection.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/generated-connection.png"><br>We're not quite done, though: a Connection is a type of progress track. Going back to our Session 0 journal, we run the <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Create a progress track</a> command and fill it out, then press "Create":<br><img alt="new-progress-trap-modal.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/new-progress-trap-modal.png"><br>Finally, we go to the NPC note and, under the roll results table, we add an embedded link to our new progress track: ![[Name of Connection Track|iv-embed]]. You'll end up with something like this:<br><img alt="embedded-connection-track.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/embedded-connection-track.png"><br>The |iv-embed part is optional, but it makes it so the usual embed decorations from Obsidian don't show up, making it look more like it's more part of the page.<br>At this point, you can do the rest of the connection creation by going back to Session 0 and rolling the rest of the recommended character oracles:<br>
<br>First Look (1-2 times)
<br>Character Goal
<br>Revealed Character Aspect (1-2 times)
<br>And add them to the NPC's results table just like we did with the zoomed-in settlement.<br>Finally, add another row to your NPC's table called "Location", and link the settlement you'd like to put them in, to wrap up your first connection:<br><img alt="completed-connection.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/completed-connection.png"><br><br>Going back to our Session 0 journal, we put our cursor under our "Starting Sector" header (or wherever you want oracle results to show up), and we go ahead and roll on the Sector Trouble table: <br><img alt="sector-trouble.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/sector-trouble.png"><br><br>To finish up, we either come up with or roll the Sector Name oracle, then we go back to our Sector map and add both the Sector Trouble and the Sector Name to that sector information card we made earlier, which only has the Region in it so far:<br><img alt="finalized-sector.png" src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/finalized-sector.png"><br>If you want, you can do what I did and make the card's contents into a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables" target="_blank">Markdown table</a> to make it look nicer.<br>Finally, go ahead and rename your Sector Canvas file to the name you ended up with, so it's not just "Untitled".<br><br>And with that, we've completed the entire Starting Sector guide! Following along with the Starforged Rulebook, that means you're ready to <a data-href="06 - Begin Your Adventure" href="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/player's-guide/getting-started/06-begin-your-adventure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">06 - Begin Your Adventure</a> and see what it's like to get into the rest of gameplay using Iron Vault!]]></description><link>https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/player's-guide/getting-started/05-build-a-starting-sector.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Player's Guide/Getting Started/05 - Build a Starting Sector.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 15:17:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/sector-initial.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://iron-vault-plugin.github.io/iron-vault/lib/media/sector-initial.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[06 - Begin Your Adventure]]></title><description><![CDATA[
