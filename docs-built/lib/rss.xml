 <br>"Blocks" are used throughout Iron Vault to provide custom rendering of various game features. Most blocks also provide interactivity, so instead of having to manually edit frontmatter data, you can do the edits through the blocks' rendered views themselves.<br>
You can use them as much or as little as you want, just like any other Iron Vault feature.<br>All blocks are used by using triple backticks (`), the name of the block, a new line, then a closing set of triple backticks.<br>Most blocks don't contain anything in order to work, but some, like <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a>, have special contents that determine how they're rendered.<br>The following blocks are supported:<br>

#### About

Ash Barlowe is a great adventurer but also a rascal.
Copy<br><br>If you want more control over how your character sheet is rendered, you can choose to use sub-blocks instead of the big single-block character sheet. You can remove the main character sheet simply by deleting the block (the thing with the backticks).<br>The following sub-blocks are available, each corresponding to a section of the full character sheet:<br>
<br>iron-vault-character-info - name, callsign, description, XP earned, XP spent
<br>iron-vault-character-stats - your character stats (edge, heart, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-meters - your character meters (health, spirit, etc, as well as momentum)
<br>iron-vault-character-special-tracks - your special progress tracks (legacy tracks like quests, bonds, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-impacts - impacts/debilities (wounded, doomed, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-assets - asset cards for your current character assets and their filled-out fields.
<br>You could, for example, use this to add headings before each section, or do the following to put your legacy tracks and your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/post/learn-from-failures-in-starforged" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/post/learn-from-failures-in-starforged" target="_blank">Delve Failure track</a> in the same place:<br>### Special Tracks

<br><br>Many commands have some mechanical effect, but additionally "add a mechanics entry to your journal".

 <br>Assets in Ironsworn/Starforged are a core mechanic for building up a character's "class" and their "inventory", of sorts. It's a fairly open-ended system that allows for interesting combinations, and it's also the core progression system of the game, where you grow your character not by upgrading their stats, but by buying new assets with XP and upgrading ones you already have.<br>Iron Vault directly supports assets in a number of ways.<br><br>Assets in most places in Iron Vault are represented as asset cards. These cards are shown in a number of places, including popup windows and your character sheet. They are only editable in the character sheet itself; otherwise, they will be shown as a read-only example:<br>

You can also use these to roll oracle groups/Entities.
<br>Manually roll the oracle using whatever reference you have and your preferred dice roller, or physical dice, and record the results in your journal using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">`oracle`</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle-group`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle-group`" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle-group`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">`oracle-group`</a> <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> nodes.

 <br>Tracks are a core feature of both Ironsworn and Starforged, as well as their expansions, and most related games. They involve filling a bar of 10 boxes, with each box taking 4 ticks to fill. On certain conditions, one or more ticks are added, and depending on the kind of track, different things can be done with that.<br>There are two main types of track in these games, and Iron Vault supports both: Progress Tracks and Special Tracks. This document only describes the former. Special Tracks are handled through the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character Sheet</a><br>Progress Tracks describe progress towards a certain goal. There are several kinds of Progress Track, such as Connections, Vows, Combat, and Scene Challenge tracks. What they have in common is that they all have something called a "rank" (ranging from "Troublesome" to "Epic"), which determines how many ticks to add on every "progress step", and they all get filled until the player does a final "Progress Move", which determines the success or failure of the event in question, and whose action value is based on the number of boxes filled.<br>There are two features supporting Progress Tracks in Iron Vault: the <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Create a progress track</a> command, and <a data-href="Track Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/track-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Track Blocks</a>. You can use the command to create a new Progress Track entity file with all the necessary metadata in its frontmatter, as well as a Track Block.

<br>Use the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin" target="_blank">Excalidraw Plugin for Obsidian</a>
<br>Everything you might want to do with Sectors should be achievable with these. For example, you can create <a data-href="Locations and Settlements" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/locations-and-settlements.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Locations and Settlements</a>, then [[link]] or ![[inline]] them in a Canvas card. You can also import an image to use as an icon representing your ship's location, and move that around as you fly through space!]]></description><link>https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/sectors.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Entities/Sectors.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 22:04:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Truths]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Iron Vault includes various settings for tweaking the behavior of its features, to allow you to shape it into a better tool for your use case.<br><br>
<br>Use character system: when enabled, this will look for an active <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character</a> file when making moves and doing other game operations. If disabled, Iron Vault will still work, but will prompt you for values of, for example, your stats. This is a good setting to disable if you only wish to use a particular subset of Iron Vault features, like <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> or the <a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar</a> but don't really care to use the various <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="About Commands" data-href="About Commands" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/about-commands.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Commands</a>.
<br><br>
<br>Default (x) folder: Controls which folder to put various rollable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/About" data-href="Entities/About" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/Entities/About" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Entities</a> in by default. You can still pick the folder on an individual basis, or even move it, regardless of what these values are.
<br>(x) template file: If provided, the contents of these files will be added to the end of the new entity files when they're created. (Coming Soon) This will eventually be replaced with a more involved template system that will give you more control of how files are generated and formatted, and what additional frontmatter they include.
<br><br>These options control various parts of how <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> are rendered.<br>
<br>Collapse move blocks: when enabled (default), moves in mechanics blocks will only show the move name and result when first rendered, and you'll need to click on them in order to see move details.
<br>Show mechanics toggle: when enabled (default), mechanics blocks will have a small "Hide mechanics" toggle underneath them that, when clicked, will hide the mechanics block.
<br>Hide mechanics completely: If enabled, mechanics blocks will not be displayed at all. Good for when you just want to read a story. You can also toggle this setting by using the <a data-href="Toggle displaying mechanics" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/toggle-displaying-mechanics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Toggle displaying mechanics</a> command.
<br><br>
<br>Prompt for rolls in Make a Move: if enabled, when you <a data-href="Make a move" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/make-a-move.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Make a move</a>, the plugin will prompt you to roll your own dice and enter the values.
<br>Prompt for rolls in Ask the Oracle: if enabled, when you <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a>, the plugin will prompt you to roll your own dice and enter the values.

<br><br>The Oracle Tab includes a list of all Oracles available in the currently-enabled Rulesets. You can filter this list by typing into its search field, which will narrow down the list to a fuzzy match based on what you're typing (meaning, you don't have to spell everything exactly right, or even write full words in the right order). When using the search field, the Oracles list will also have its groups reordered by top match.<br>In order to roll an oracle on this tab, you can expand its group if needed, then click on the oracle name, which will invoke the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a> command using that oracle.

The game, after all, is not a single monolithic set of laws, and everyone tends to take their own liberties with the rules in the interest of enjoying the game more.<br><br>You can start reading about the various Iron Vault features here:<br>

<br><a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar</a> - A handy right-panel sidebar for quick access to Moves, Oracles, and your Character Sheet, all in one, easy-access place. Particularly useful on mobile.
<br><a data-href="Special Links" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/special-links.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Special Links</a> - There are oracle:, move:, asset: and id: links that, instead of trying to open a web page, will instead open a modal window with the contents of the thing you're trying to link to. For example, [My Oracle](oracle:MyOracleName) will pop up a window with the description and roll table for "My Oracle".
