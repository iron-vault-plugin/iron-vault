 <br>"Blocks" are used throughout Iron Vault to provide custom rendering of various game features. Most blocks also provide interactivity, so instead of having to manually edit frontmatter data, you can do the edits through the blocks' rendered views themselves.<br>
You can use them as much or as little as you want, just like any other Iron Vault feature.<br>All blocks are used by using triple backticks (`), the name of the block, a new line, then a closing set of triple backticks.<br>Most blocks don't contain anything in order to work, but some, like <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mechanics Blocks</a>, have special contents that determine how they're rendered.<br>The following blocks are supported:<br>
<br><a data-href="Asset Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/asset-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Asset Blocks</a> (iron-vault-assets) - inline asset cards (with read-only, no settings).
<br>
<br><a data-href="Character Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/character-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Character Blocks</a> (iron-vault-character) - a character sheet, or the more fine-grained versions:

<br>iron-vault-character-info
<br>iron-vault-character-stats
<br>iron-vault-character-meters
<br>iron-vault-character-special-tracks
<br>iron-vault-character-impacts

<br><a data-href="Clock Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/clock-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Clock Blocks</a> (iron-vault-clock) - for tension clock notes
<br><a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mechanics Blocks</a> (iron-vault-mechanics) - fancy drawing of mechanics, intended for use in journal pages.
<br><a data-href="Moves Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/moves-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Moves Blocks</a> (iron-vault-moves) - searchable list of moves (same thing as the <a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar</a>, but useful if you want to embed it directly in a note)
<br><a data-href="Oracles Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/oracles-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oracles Blocks</a> (iron-vault-oracles) - searchable list of oracles (same thing as the <a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar</a>, but useful if you want to embed it directly in a note)

 <br>Truth blocks are used to render pickers for individual truths. When filled out and saved, they will insert the final truth text underneath themselves into the current file.<br><a data-href="Truths" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Truths</a> are a core Ironsworn/Starforged concept, and one of the first things you'll do when you start a campaign. You can easily generate a Truths file with all your current rulesets' truths by using the <a data-href="Generate Truths" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/generate-truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Generate Truths</a> command.<br>Truth blocks expect the name of the Truth they'll be dealing with as the first line in their bodies. A second optional line with the text inserted will set the Truth block to its "click to reset" state, and is usually automatically written when you click save on the block.<br>Resetting the Truth block will reset it to its initial state and insert an Old Truth: header underneath, to separate your previously-generated truth text from the new one, so it won't delete any text you had there before that you might want to keep or reference.<br>Truth blocks let you either pick your truth options from a dropdown, or click on a die icon to randomize them according to the rules' oracle table.<br>Once the Truth is generated, you are free to edit the Truth text any way you see fit: it's just regular text in the file!<br>You can also choose to split your truths between multiple files, by just putting the iron-vault-truth blocks into separate files.<br><br>The following file:<br>## Cataclysm
```iron-vault-truth
Cataclysm
```
<br>Will generate something that looks like this:<br><br>Truths.md<br><br>
          This file is not part of a campaign, but a campaign is needed for a
          truths block.
        <br><br>If you select all required items, you'll be able to click on the save icon, at which point you'll end up with this:<br><br>Truths.md<br><br>
          This file is not part of a campaign, but a campaign is needed for a

 <br>Track blocks are used to represent Progress Tracks, a core Ironsworn and Starforged feature.<br><a data-href="Progress Tracks" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/progress-tracks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Progress Tracks</a> in Iron Vault are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/index" data-href="Entities/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Entities</a>, and can only have one note per Track, since their data is stored in frontmatter. These Tracks can be placed anywhere as long as they have the right metadata, which they require in order to render correctly. You can use <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Create a progress track</a> to generate these.<br><br>The following file:<br>---

#### About

Ash Barlowe is a great adventurer but also a rascal.
<br><br>If you want more control over how your character sheet is rendered, you can choose to use sub-blocks instead of the big single-block character sheet. You can remove the main character sheet simply by deleting the block (the thing with the backticks).<br>The following sub-blocks are available, each corresponding to a section of the full character sheet:<br>
<br>iron-vault-character-info - name, callsign, description, XP earned, XP spent
<br>iron-vault-character-stats - your character stats (edge, heart, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-meters - your character meters (health, spirit, etc, as well as momentum)
<br>iron-vault-character-special-tracks - your special progress tracks (legacy tracks like quests, bonds, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-impacts - impacts/debilities (wounded, doomed, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-assets - asset cards for your current character assets and their filled-out fields.
<br>You could, for example, use this to add headings before each section, or do the following to put your legacy tracks and your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/post/learn-from-failures-in-starforged" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/post/learn-from-failures-in-starforged" target="_blank">Delve Failure track</a> in the same place:<br>### Special Tracks

```iron-vault-character-special-tracks
```
![[Failure]]
<br>Will render the following:<br><img alt="special-tracks-example.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/special-tracks-example.png"><br><br>You can reference a character file in a character block if you want to, say, put character blocks in a Canvas card instead of embedding a note. To do this, simply put the name of the character or a path to its filename in the body of the block:<br>```iron-vault-character-stats
Alex Starfarer

 <br>Iron Vault is organized around campaigns. A single vault can have many campaigns, and, even if you only plan to run a single campaign in your vault, you'll still create a single root campaign.<br>A campaign is a folder (called the campaign root folder) with a campaign index file in its root. All files (including those within subfolders) within the campaign root folder are considered part of the campaign. In particular, all <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/index" data-href="Entities/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tracked Entities</a> for a campaign, such as <a data-href="Characters" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Characters</a>, <a data-href="Progress Tracks" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/progress-tracks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Progress Tracks</a>, and <a data-href="Clocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/clocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Clocks</a>, must exist somewhere within the campaign root folder tree.<br>Campaigns cannot be nested
Because campaigns include all files underneath them, one campaign cannot be nested within another. If Iron Vault detects this situation, you will see an error message when you attempt to use most Iron Vault features.
<br>To create a new campaign, use the <a data-href="Creating a campaign" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/creating-a-campaign.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creating a campaign</a> command. This will create a campaign index file in a new or existing folder you designate. You can also <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Editing a campaign" data-href="Editing a campaign" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/editing-a-campaign.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">edit a campaign</a> to change its properties later.<br>Campaign file frontmatter
Your campaign file contains a frontmatter property called ironvault. This contains important data about your campaign configuration that is not intended for manual editing. Use caution when editing the frontmatter of your campaign file.
<br><br>The most important property of a campaign is its <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Campaigns/Playsets/index" data-href="Campaigns/Playsets/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/playsets/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Playset</a>. The playset defines which <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rulesets and Homebrew</a> content is available in your campaign. Whenever your campaign is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Active campaign and active character" data-href="#Active campaign and active character" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Active_campaign_and_active_character" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">active</a>, your playset determines what moves, oracles, and assets are available within the various commands, sidebars, and views.<br><br>When you are viewing a file that is within a campaign, that campaign becomes the active campaign. The active campaign provides a context for many operations within Iron Vault, such as which progress tracks to list and what moves/oracles are available.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters > Active character" data-href="Characters#Active character" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/characters.html#Active_character" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Active character</a> is tracked per campaign, so when the active campaign switches, the active character will switch to the most recent active character within that campaign.<br><br> If you only plan to use this vault for a single campaign, you can create a campaign in the root folder. This is the simplest setup, as it means that everything in the vault will be part of that one campaign.<br>If you plan to use this vault for multiple campaigns, you need to give each campaign its own separate folder. There are a variety of ways to organize this:<br>
<br>Make each campaign a subfolder of the root folder: this is the default setup for the plugin and avoids excessive nesting.
<br>Make each campaign a subfolder of a "Campaigns" folder: use this if you'd like to keep your top-level folder more organized.
<br>Group your campaigns in some more complicated way: you're free to organize your campaign folders however you wish, as long as you follow the rule that each campaign gets its own folder.

One is to add it to your configured vault-wide Homebrew folder and then include the package in a custom playset. Use this option if you are importing Datasworn packages from third parties or are creating your own reusable package.
The other option is to use the campaign-specific custom content folder. In this case, you do not need a custom playset; the content in this folder will be compiled into a package and included automatically in your campaign.

 <br>You can create a custom playset using a relatively simple syntax that will be familiar to anyone who has worked with .gitignore files before.<br>To get started, while you are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Creating a campaign" data-href="Creating a campaign" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/creating-a-campaign.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">creating</a> or <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Editing a campaign" data-href="Editing a campaign" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/editing-a-campaign.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">editing</a> a campaign, click the Configure button next to the Custom playset option. This will launch the Playset editor modal:<br><img alt="Playset editor.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/playset-editor.png" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>From here, you can browse the built-in playsets for inspiration and then when you are ready choose "Custom playset" from the "Playset" dropdown.<br>As you type, validation messages will display below the edit box so you know if you have any syntax issues. The search list at the bottom will also update to show you which content would be included and which excluded by your configuration.<br><br>A playset is a set of lines that tell Iron Vault which content it should include or exclude.<br>Here's an example config that you might use if you were running a hard sci-fi Starforged game:<br>@include(starforged)
asset:sundered_isles/** [starforged.recommended=true]
!asset:** [core.supernatural=true]
<br>This does three things:<br>
<br>Includes the built-in "starforged" playset
<br>Adds to it all assets from Sundered Isles that are tagged as "recommended" for Starforged
<br>Filters out any of the Starforged or Sundered Isles assets that are tagged as "supernatural"
<br>Before we can describe the playset syntax in detail, we need to cover a few prerequisites first.<br><br><br>As discussed in <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rulesets and Homebrew</a>, Iron Vault is built on top of the <a data-href="Datasworn" href="https://ironvault.quest/Datasworn" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Datasworn</a> library. You can think of a Datasworn rules package as a tree-structured representation of all of the content in Ironsworn/Starforged/etc. Each piece of independent content (e.g., a move, an asset, an oracle) has an ID of the form:<br>&lt;type&gt;:&lt;package id&gt;/&lt;path&gt;<br>The Datasworn types currently supported by Iron Vault playsets are:<br>
<br>oracle_rollable
<br>move
<br>asset
<br>truth
<br>Iron Vault playsets can also filter on an additional "virtual type":<br>
<br>rules_package

<br>This virtual type corresponds to the base of a Datasworn ruleset or expansion file. In particular, you must include this to get Datasworn rules elements, such as stats, condition meters, and impacts.
<br>We also use the rules_package IDs to activate special handling specific to different base rulesets but not represented in Datasworn currently, such as the terminology for combat initiative/position.
<br>IDs of this type include only the package ID and no path, e.g., rules_package:starforged matches the starforged rules package


<br><br>The main Datasworn types listed above are used to describe roughly standalone content, such as a core game move or a complete asset. In addition, sometimes content is intended for use only in the context of another piece of content. For example, some assets (for example, Starforged's Empath asset) grant you additional moves (e.g., Empath's "Read heart" move); in the Empath example, we say the "Read Heart" move is embedded in the "Empath" asset.<br>IDs for embedded content combine multiple corresponding segments of types and paths. Continuing with the example above, "Read Heart" has ID asset.ability.move:starforged/path/empath.0.read_heart. Reading this from right to left, this tells us we are looking for a move called "read_heart" that is in ability "0" (the first ability) of the asset at starforged/path/empath.<br><br>In addition to IDs, some Datasworn content is marked with tags of the form &lt;package id&gt;.&lt;tag id&gt;. This is currently used to mark Starforged assets recommended for Sundered Isles (and vice versa) as well as the Sundered Isles "technological" and "supernatural" designations.<br><br>Iron Vault introduces a way to match patterns on Datasworn IDs using wildcard expressions (similar to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)" target="_blank">shell path globs</a>).<br>Like a Datasworn ID, each pattern must have the form:<br>&lt;type pattern&gt;:&lt;path pattern&gt;<br>Type pattern can be either * or any of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Datasworn IDs" data-href="#Datasworn IDs" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Datasworn_IDs" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Datasworn types described above</a>. A * matches any Datasworn type whatsoever.<br>A path pattern is made up of one or more path segments separated by a / character. A path segment can be a mix of legal literal characters (a-z, 0-9, _, and -) and wildcards (*), which match zero or more legal characters. For example, e*e* would match empowered and explorer but not empath. A wildcard in a path segment never matches a /.<br>A path segment can also be a **, which functions like * but matches 0 or more complete path segments. For example asset:starforged/** matches asset:starforged, asset:starforged/path, and asset:starforged/path/empath.<br>A datasworn ID glob ALWAYS matches all <a data-href="#Embedded content" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Embedded_content" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Embedded content</a> under a matching pattern. Thus, the pattern asset:starforged/path/empath also matches asset.ability.move:starforged/path/empath.0.read_heart.<br><br>With those fundamentals, we can now describe the syntax of the playset configuration.<br>Each line of a playset configuration must be one of the following:<br>
<br>A <a data-href="#Glob statement" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Glob_statement" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glob statement</a>
<br>An <a data-href="#@include statement" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#@include_statement" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">@include statement</a>
<br>You may also include blank lines or comment lines starting with #; these will be ignored.<br>When determining whether a playset includes a particular piece of content, Iron Vault goes through each of the lines from last to first, until it finds a line that matches the content and issues a determination (either an explicit include or exclude). If no line generates a determination, the playset will exclude the content implicitly.<br><br>A glob statement is a <a data-href="#Datasworn ID globs" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Datasworn_ID_globs" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Datasworn ID globs</a> as described above. If the glob matches the current content, then an explicit include determination will be made.<br>If the line is prefixed with a !, an explicit exclude determination will be made instead.<br>A glob statement can also be refined by tags. These tags must match, in addition to the ID glob matching, in order for this line to match and generate a determination. To match a single tag, add [packageId.tagId=value] after the glob. Multiple tags can be matched by separating them with an ampersand, e.g., [pkg1.tag1=value&amp;pkg1.tag2=value&amp;pkg2.tag3=value].<br>Tag values can either be:<br>
<br>A boolean value true or false
<br>A number, e.g., 1
<br>A string enclosed in double quotes, e.g., "this string"
<br>Examples:<br># Include everything in the starforged rules package
*:starforged/**

# Include all Sundered Isles assets (and their embedded content)
#  as long as they have the starforged.recommended=true tag
asset:sundered_isles/** [starforged.recommended=true]

# Exclude all assets that are tagged as technological
!asset:** [core.technological=true]
<br>Because the last pattern wins, this playset config would include everything in starforged and all Sundered Isles assets that are tagged as recommended EXCEPT that it would exclude ANY asset that is tagged as technological (in both Starforged and Sundered Isles)<br><br>A line of the form @include(playsetid) incorporates all of the lines of the built-in Playset with id playsetid in place of the @include line.

You can use the campaign file as a home page for your campaign-- the important data for Iron Vault is stored in the frontmatter ironvault property. Use caution when editing the frontmatter and especially that property.<br><img alt="Create a new campaign modal.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/create-a-new-campaign-modal.png" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;"><br>First, choose the options you'd like for your new campaign:<br>
<br>Campaign name: the name of your campaign. This sets the file name of the campaign file (for easy linking) as well as the display name used by Iron Vault when referring to your campaign.
<br>Folder: the folder that will house your campaign. By default, this will match the Campaign name but you may choose a different path if you wish.

<br>As noted in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Campaigns/index" data-href="Campaigns/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Campaigns</a>, you may not nest campaigns.

You may select a built-in playset for official content using the toggles displayed, or you may configure a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Custom playsets" data-href="Custom playsets" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/playsets/custom-playsets.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">custom playset</a>.
<br>Scaffold campaign: when this option is enabled (recommended), the following files and folders will be created in addition to the campaign root and campaign index:

<br>Default entity folders: folders will be created for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/index" data-href="Entities/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tracked Entities</a> based on the defaults you chose in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Settings > New game object defaults" data-href="Settings#New game object defaults" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/settings.html#New_game_object_defaults" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the "New game object defaults" settings</a>.
<br>Truths: a <a data-href="Truths" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Truths</a> file ready for you to select game truths
<br>Initial character: finally, the <a data-href="Create new character" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/create-new-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Create new character</a> modal will be shown, allowing you to create an initial character for your campaign.


<br>Folders

<br>Campaign content: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Rulesets and Homebrew > Custom Source Folders (experimental)" data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew#Custom Source Folders (experimental)" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html#Custom_Source_Folders_(experimental)" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Custom content</a> placed in this folder will be automatically included in your campaign playset. Use this to quickly include campaign-specific oracle arrays!


<br>Once you're ready, click Create to create your campaign and optionally the scaffold.

Not all Iron Vault features have been validated against non-standard challenge dice settings.

    - "ouch"
}
move "Endure Harm" {
    meter "health" from=3 to=2
    roll action=3 stat=4 adds=0 vs1=3 vs2=5
}
```
<br><br>For some moves, like suffer moves, making a roll is sometimes optional. In those cases, you can still record that you made the move by selecting "Skip roll" when you are prompted for the stat. This will record an empty move block, where you can then record your meter changes and so on.<br>If you then wish to add an action roll, you can run <a data-href="Make an action roll" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/make-an-action-roll.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Make an action roll</a>. As long as the move with the skipped roll is still the last entry in the preceding mechanics block, the roll will be added to that move, after all other children.<br>You can use this process to create the Endure Harm node as above:<br>
<br><a data-href="Make a move" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/make-a-move.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Make a move</a> with "Endure Harm", picking "Skip roll" as the rollable stat when prompted.
<br>Use other commands, such as <a data-href="Suffer on a meter" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/suffer-on-a-meter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Suffer on a meter</a>, to add other entries to the Endure Harm node.
<br>Finally, if you decide you wish to make the Endure Harm roll, run <a data-href="Make an action roll" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/make-an-action-roll.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Make an action roll</a>. It will detect that the last move was Endure Harm and prompt you appropriately. The roll will be added to your Endure Harm block!

 <br>This command is similar to <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ask the Oracle</a>, except that instead of rolling a single Oracle, it pops up a window that will let you roll multiple related Oracles together to generate a new <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/index" data-href="Entities/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Entity</a>. You can choose to roll all fields indicated as "first look" fields in the rulebook and/or you can roll individual fields. You can also choose whether to write the results into a new file representing that Entity.

<br>Each attribute of the entity is shown on a new row.

<br>The underlined text is the rolled result.
<br>The smaller text below is the name of the attribute.

<br>"Roll" (dice icon): roll a new value for this attribute. (If an attribute supports multiple rolls, this will add a new roll, rather than replacing it.)
<br>"Clear" (delete icon): delete the rolls from this row

 <br>Iron Vault supports Truths through three main features: <a data-href="Truth Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/truth-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Truth Blocks</a>, the <a data-href="Generate Truths" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/generate-truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Generate Truths</a> command, and its <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rulesets and Homebrew</a> capabilities.<br>In summary, the experience is that you first use the <a data-href="Generate Truths" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/generate-truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Generate Truths</a> command to create a Truths file somewhere in your vault, then you interact with the generated <a data-href="Truth Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/truth-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Truth Blocks</a> to pick each truth. The Truths file will be populated according to the Truths outlined in your active <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rulesets and Homebrew</a>.<br>Once the Truths file is generated and your Truths are picked, you're free to edit the file however you wish, even split it up into multiple files if that's what you prefer. You can carry around the Truth Block along with it, and it'll Just Work.<br>For more information on the process of picking your truths, see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Truth Blocks > Example" data-href="Truth Blocks#Example" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/truth-blocks.html#Example" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Truth Blocks example</a> and its documentation.]]></description><link>https://ironvault.quest/entities/truths.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Entities/Truths.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 19:41:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Settlements]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Iron Vault has support for Settlements by using the related Oracle Entity, which can be rolled either through the <a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar</a> or through the <a data-href="Generate an entity" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/generate-an-entity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Generate an entity</a> command. You'll be given the option to save the results into a new file, which will include a Markdown table with all the roll results. Rolling this oracle group will also record the results in your journal.<br>Besides this, there is no additional support specific to locations and settlements. You are free to organize these entities however you want, including having multiple settlements in a single file (although we recommend doing 1-entity, 1-file as a general rule).<br>For mapping, you can use anything you want! One idea might be to generate maps with something like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://watabou.github.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://watabou.github.io/" target="_blank">Procgen Arcana</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://wyvernindustries.itch.io/stationgen" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://wyvernindustries.itch.io/stationgen" target="_blank">StationArchitect</a> or <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dungeondraft.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://dungeondraft.net/" target="_blank">DungeonDraft</a> then use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://phd20.com/blog/creating-a-basic-interactive-map-in-obsidian/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://phd20.com/blog/creating-a-basic-interactive-map-in-obsidian/" target="_blank">this guide on creating an interactive map</a> to make it all very pretty and linkable.]]></description><link>https://ironvault.quest/entities/settlements.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Entities/Settlements.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 19:41:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sectors]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Tracks are a core feature of both Ironsworn and Starforged, as well as their expansions, and most related games. They involve filling a bar of 10 boxes, with each box taking 4 ticks to fill. On certain conditions, one or more ticks are added, and depending on the kind of track, different things can be done with that.<br>There are two main types of track in these games, and Iron Vault supports both: Progress Tracks and Special Tracks. This document only describes the former. Special Tracks are handled through the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Character Sheet</a><br>Progress Tracks describe progress towards a certain goal. There are several kinds of Progress Track, such as Connections, Vows, Combat, and Scene Challenge tracks. What they have in common is that they all have something called a "rank" (ranging from "Troublesome" to "Epic"), which determines how many ticks to add on every "progress step", and they all get filled until the player does a final "Progress Move", which determines the success or failure of the event in question, and whose action value is based on the number of boxes filled.<br>There are two features supporting Progress Tracks in Iron Vault: the <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Create a progress track</a> command, and <a data-href="Track Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/track-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Track Blocks</a>. You can use the command to create a new Progress Track entity file with all the necessary metadata in its frontmatter, as well as a Track Block. You can then add any more details you want to that file.<br><br>Write the Docs<br><br>

 <br>Oracles are a core Ironsworn/Starforged games, and solo roleplaying games in general. They allow you to inject randomness and unpredictability into your games, as well as serve as inspiration for what to do next when you feel stuck in your story.<br><br>There's three ways to roll Oracles in Iron Vault:<br>
<br>Use the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ask the Oracle</a> command.
<br>Find the Oracle on the <a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar</a>'s Oracles tab and either click on the Oracle itself, or click on the dice icon in order to view its roll table in a popup window. You can also use these to roll oracle groups/Entities.
<br>Manually roll the oracle using whatever reference you have and your preferred dice roller, or physical dice, and record the results in your journal using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">`oracle`</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle-group`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle-group`" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle-group`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">`oracle-group`</a> <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mechanics Blocks</a> nodes.
<br>The first two options will automatically record your oracle results in your active journal note.<br><br>You can record the results in your journal using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">`oracle`</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle-group`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle-group`" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle-group`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">`oracle-group`</a> <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mechanics Blocks</a> nodes, which will be rendered nicely in your journal pages.<br><br><br><br>

From there, you may click on the button with the die icon to roll the oracle table itself.<br>If you decide you want to use the cursed result, you can click on the "Select" button next to the cursed result once you've rolled it.<br>This will add an oracle mechanics node with a nested cursed oracle. If the cursed oracle is a replacement, the "parent"'s result will be crossed out.<br><br>(Coming Soon)<br>Oracle Arrays are an optional tool introduced in Starforged. They allow you to associate a set of oracles with a six-sided die, called the "array die", which will help you decide which oracles to roll in specific situations.<br>There is currently no direct support for Oracle Arrays, but this is an upcoming feature.<br><br>(Coming Soon)<br>Campaign Elements Oracles are an optional tool introduced in Starforged. They are handcrafted tables of story ingredients specific to a campaign, which can be used to help you in open-ended situations, or when you just need a bit more inspiration.<br>There is currently no direct support for Campaign Elements Oracles, but this is an upcoming feature.<br><br>(Coming Soon)<br>The last new optional Oracle kind introduced in Starforged was something it calls "madlib" oracles, where you fill in a madlibs-style sentence with Oracle results, which look like "I swear to Action a Theme of a Descriptor Focus located in Sector Name.

 <br>Assets in Ironsworn/Starforged are a core mechanic for building up a character's "class" and their "inventory", of sorts. It's a fairly open-ended system that allows for interesting combinations, and it's also the core progression system of the game, where you grow your character not by upgrading their stats, but by buying new assets with XP and upgrading ones you already have.<br>Iron Vault directly supports assets in a number of ways.<br><br>Assets in most places in Iron Vault are represented as asset cards. These cards are shown in a number of places, including popup windows and your character sheet. They are only editable in the character sheet itself; otherwise, they will be shown as a read-only example:<br>
          Asset block may only be used within a campaign folder.
        <br><br>You can add assets to your character two different ways:<br>
<br>Using the <a data-href="Add asset to character" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/add-asset-to-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Add asset to character</a> command.
<br>Click on the Add Asset button in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Character Blocks" data-href="Character Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/character-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Character Sheet</a>
<br>Both of these methods will add the asset directly to your character sheet. The first method will also add a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `asset`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`asset`" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`asset`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mechanics block `asset` node</a> to your journal denoting that an asset was added.<br>Once you have an asset in your character sheet, you can remove it by clicking the "x" button on the top right of the asset.<br>You can also reorder assets by going to your character sheet's asset section and click-dragging the top section of the asset card then dropping it in the spot you want it to move to.<br>When in your character sheet, you can edit all option fields of your assets, such as a name if the asset calls for one, or picking an associated stat. You can also mark of unmark abilities by clicking on the hexagon next to them.<br><br>You can link to an asset's definition card using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Special Links > Assets" data-href="Special Links#Assets" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/special-links.html#Assets" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">`asset:` links</a>. When clicked, these links will open a popup window with a read-only, default version of the asset for reference.<br><br>You can embed an asset's read-only card using <a data-href="Asset Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/asset-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Asset Blocks</a>. These blocks will not be associated with your character's assets and are only for reference of the original asset definition.<br><br>(Coming Soon)<br>In the future, Iron Vault will support custom <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rulesets and Homebrew</a>, including individual homebrew assets.]]></description><link>https://ironvault.quest/entities/assets.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Entities/Assets.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 19:41:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Other Features]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Iron Vault overrides a number of kinds of links to change their behavior: instead of trying to open a link in your browser, they will open a pop window/modal with the entity they link to.<br>You can use special links using external link syntax ([Name of Link](type:path/a/b)), where type:path/a/b is one of the following:<br>
<br>a complete Datasworn ID prefixed with datasworn:, as in [Face Danger](datasworn:move:starforged/adventure/face_danger), [Read Heart](datasworn:asset.ability.move:starforged/path/empath.0.read_heart), or [Space Creature Basic Form](datasworn:oracle_rollable:starforged/creature/basic_form/space)
<br>move:, oracle:, or asset: followed by the name of a move, oracle, or asset. The name must have no spaces, but you can capitalize it however you want. For example, [Face Danger](move:Facedanger).
<br>The following Datasworn entity types are clickable:<br><br>Clicking on a move link will open a popup window with move details.<br>Example: [Face Danger](move:FaceDanger) or [Face Danger](datasworn:move:starforged/adventure/face_danger) will open a popup window that looks like this:<br><img alt="face-danger-link.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/face-danger-link.png"><br><br>Clicking an Oracle link will open a popup window with the Oracle move table. When referencing by name, you'll need to remove any spaces.<br>Example: [Background Assets](datasworn:oracle_rollable:starforged/campaign_launch/background_assets) will render as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="oracle_rollable:starforged/campaign_launch/background_assets" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ironvault.quest/oracle_rollable:starforged/campaign_launch/background_assets" target="_blank" data-datasworn-id="oracle_rollable:starforged/campaign_launch/background_assets" data-datasworn-kind="oracle_rollable">Background Assets</a><br><img alt="background-assets-link.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/background-assets-link.png"><br><br>Clicking an asset will open a popup window with a read-only Asset card.<br>Example: [Gunslinger](datasworn:asset:Gunslinger) will open a popup window that looks like:<br>

<br><br>The Oracle Tab includes a list of all Oracles available in the currently-enabled Rulesets. You can filter this list by typing into its search field, which will narrow down the list to a fuzzy match based on what you're typing (meaning, you don't have to spell everything exactly right, or even write full words in the right order). When using the search field, the Oracles list will also have its groups reordered by top match.<br>In order to roll an oracle on this tab, you can expand its group if needed, then click on the oracle name, which will invoke the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ask the Oracle</a> command using that oracle. If you want to pick from the oracle table yourself or just see the table for reference, you can click on the button with the list icon next to the oracle name to open a popup window with the oracle table, and a button for rolling that oracle if you then want to roll it.<br>Each Oracle group in the Oracle Tab also has a button with a die icon before its list of oracles.

 <br> Iron Vault includes various settings for tweaking the behavior of its features, to allow you to shape it into a better tool for your use case.<br><br>
<br>Use character system: when enabled, this will look for an active <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Character</a> file when making moves and doing other game operations. If disabled, Iron Vault will still work, but will prompt you for values of, for example, your stats. This is a good setting to disable if you only wish to use a particular subset of Iron Vault features, like <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mechanics Blocks</a> or the <a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar</a> but don't really care to use the various <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Commands/index" data-href="Commands/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Commands</a>.
<br>Always prompt for active character: If enabled, the plugin will always prompt when taking an action where an active character is required, if there are multiple characters in the campaign. Otherwise, it will remember the last used active character. You can also change the active character with the <a data-href="Pick active character" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/pick-active-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pick active character</a> command.
<br>Reset to default: returns all settings to their default values.
<br><br>For more on homebrew, see <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew#Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html#Homebrew" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rulesets and Homebrew &gt; Homebrew</a>.<br>
<br>Enable Homebrew content: when enabled, content from the folder below will be loaded and available for play.
<br>Homebrew content folder: a folder (which must exist if Enable Homebrew content is on) from which to load homebrew content. Currently all JSON files in Datasworn format in the root of this folder will be loaded.
<br><br>
<br>Prompt for rolls in Make a Move: if enabled, when you <a data-href="Make a move" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/make-a-move.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Make a move</a>, the plugin will prompt you to roll your own dice and enter the values.
<br>Prompt for rolls in Ask the Oracle: if enabled, when you <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ask the Oracle</a>, the plugin will prompt you to roll your own dice and enter the values.
<br>Cursed die kind: The type of die to roll when making cursed die rolls.
<br>Enable cursed die: If enabled, the cursed die will be rolled along with the oracle die when rolling an oracle with an associated cursed oracle table.
<br>Graphical (oracle/action) dice: When enabled, 3d graphical dice will be rolled on-screen whenever a die roll of the specified kind is made.
<br>Show dice debugger: When enabled, a small overlay will appear in the top-right corner during a graphical dice roll. It will show the formula used to calculate the roll result. This can help explain "non-standard" dice rolls like d36 which is rolled with two d6s.
<br>Hide dice delay: Number of seconds to keep graphical dice on the screen after a roll ends. If 0, dice will remain until a click or key press.
<br>Allow dice clickthrough: By default, the graphical dice "capture" the mouse, and you must click once to clear away the dice before you can interact with the rest of the app. When this setting is enabled, the dice still remain visible until you click, but the app will react to your click as if the dice were not visible.
<br>(x) die color: Sets the color of the various supported dice. Challenge dice may be colored separately in order to support Sundered Isles' Twin Fates feature (Cinder/Wraith).
<br><br>
<br>Default (x) folder: Controls which subfolder of your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Campaigns/index" data-href="Campaigns/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">campaign root</a> to put various rollable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/index" data-href="Entities/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Entities</a> in by default. You can still pick the folder on an individual basis, or even move it, regardless of what these values are.
<br>(x) template file: If provided, the contents of these files will be added to the end of the new entity files when they're created. (Coming Soon) This will eventually be replaced with a more involved template system that will give you more control of how files are generated and formatted, and what additional frontmatter they include.
<br><br>These options control various parts of how <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mechanics Blocks</a> are rendered.<br>
<br>Collapse move blocks: when enabled  moves in mechanics blocks will only show the move name and result when first rendered, and you'll need to click on them in order to see move details.
<br>Show mechanics toggle: when enabled, mechanics blocks will have a small "Hide mechanics" toggle underneath them that, when clicked, will hide the mechanics block.
<br>Hide mechanics completely: If enabled, mechanics blocks will not be displayed at all. Good for when you just want to read a story. You can also toggle this setting by using the <a data-href="Toggle displaying mechanics" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/toggle-displaying-mechanics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Toggle displaying mechanics</a> command.
<br>Inline tracks on clock creation: If enabled, new tracks and clocks will be automatically inlined in the journal when created.
<br><br>

 <br>Rules packages define a collection of game-specific content and/or rules that fall within the scope of the Ironsworn/Starforged family of games, but with some leeway for variance. For example, rules packages can define Assets, Moves, and Oracles, and even things like Meters and Stats. There are various ways of defining and activating rulesets in Iron Vault.<br>You select which content is part of your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Campaigns/index" data-href="Campaigns/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Campaign</a> by configuring your Campaign's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Campaigns/Playsets/index" data-href="Campaigns/Playsets/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/playsets/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">index</a>.<br><br>Iron Vault relies on the official <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> library for two key elements:<br>
<br>A structure (also known as a schema) for representing as data the components of an Ironsworn-based game, such as the moves, assets, and oracles.

The Datasworn Sundered Isles data is considered a preview, awaiting finalization of the Sundered Isles rulebook.
<br><br>Iron Vault supports custom homebrew rules packages. You can provide these packages in two formats:<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Rulesets and Homebrew > Compiled Datasworn JSON" data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew#Compiled Datasworn JSON" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html#Compiled_Datasworn_JSON" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Compiled Datasworn JSON</a>: pre-compiled Datasworn json files can be dropped directly in the Homebrew folder as a complete package
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Rulesets and Homebrew > Custom Source Folders" data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew#Custom Source Folders" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html#Custom_Source_Folders" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Custom Source Folders</a>: you can also build Datasworn packages from a mixture of Datasworn "source" YAML and Markdown files in a custom Iron Vault format.
<br><br>Custom rules packages can be loaded from JSON files following the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> specification. Files must be in a format compatible with the Datasworn 0.1.0 release. For more information on Datasworn versions, see <a data-href="Data versions and vault migration" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/data-versions-and-vault-migration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Data versions and vault migration</a>.<br>To enable this, put your homebrew content in a folder in your vault. In settings, turn on Enable Homebrew content in Settings and set Homebrew content folder to the folder with your content.<br>Note that, in addition, you might need to enable Settings &gt; Files and links &gt; Detect all file extensions in order for .json files to show up in your vault. The file will be there, you just won't see it.<br><br>Iron Vault bundles the Datasworn compiler-- with some enhancements-- allowing you to compose homebrew content from files in a variety of formats.<br>Iron Vault will attempt to compile each subfolder of your Homebrew directory as a custom Datasworn package, using the folder name as the package id.<br>Custom Source Folders are a new feature and under active development.
While functionality that is in place should generally work as described, some functionality is still rough around the edges. We welcome constructive feedback, bug reports, and contributions!
<br><br>To use such a package, you'll need to make sure it is included in your campaign's playset. For example, if you have a folder Homebrew/mycontent, you'll want to make sure your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Campaigns/Playsets/index" data-href="Campaigns/Playsets/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/playsets/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">playset</a> has a line like *:mycontent/** to ensure that all of your custom content is available.<br>Alternatively, use the <a data-href="#Campaign-specific custom content" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Campaign-specific_custom_content" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Campaign-specific custom content</a> feature to add content that is included automatically.<br>Content refreshes automatically
When you change files in a custom source folder, Iron Vault recompiles that package automatically. This also means that if a change causes a file to fail compilation, that file's content (such as an oracle) will become unavailable immediately. We recommend keeping the Homebrew Inspector sidebar tab open while editing so you can see errors as they occur.
<br><br>We support three kinds of files, currently:<br>
<br>Datasworn Source rules packages YAML files (type: ruleset or expansion)
<br>Datasworn Source standalone entry YAML files (type: move or asset or oracle_rollable)
<br>Markdown files in a custom Iron Vault format for:

<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Markdown oracle files" data-href="#Markdown oracle files" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Markdown_oracle_files" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oracles</a>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Markdown asset files" data-href="#Markdown asset files" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Markdown_asset_files" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Assets</a>


<br>Datasworn Source rules package YAML files can be placed anywhere in the tree, and they are merged, unmodified, into the final source passed into the Datasworn compiler. This matches the behavior of the official Datasworn source data structure in the <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">https://github.com/rsek/datasworn</a>, and so you can always use those files as models for structuring your content.<br>Other file types must be organized into folders, and Iron Vault will build Datasworn collections from the contained files, using the folder structure to generate IDs. A folder must contain content of the same type (e.g., you cannot put moves and oracles in the same folder).<br>For example, imagine you have this structure:<br>
<br>Homebrew

<br>mycontent

<br>Campaign

<br>My Campaign Oracle.md (An IronVault markdown inline-oracle)
<br>My Other Campaign Oracle.yaml (A Datasworn oracle_rollable file)


<br>mymoves

<br>learn_from_your_failures.yaml (A Datasworn move YAML file)






<br>Assuming these files are all correctly formatted, this will lead to the creation of the following Datasworn entities:<br>
<br>oracle_collection:mycontent/campaign: An Oracle Collection named "Campaign" that contains the oracles:

<br>oracle_rollable:mycontent/campaign/my_campaign_oracle: An oracle table parsed from a markdown file
<br>oracle_rollable:mycontent/campaign/my_other_campaign_oracle: An oracle table parsed from a Datasworn Source file


<br>move_category:mycontent/mymoves: A Move Category named mymoves

<br>move:mycontent/mymoves/learn_from_your_failures: A move parsed from the Datasworn Source file


<br><br>Let's suppose that you wanted to change the display name of the mymoves category and provide a value for the Datasworn MoveCategory summary field. In the mymoves folder, you can create a file _index.md (in this example, the full path would be Homebrew/mycontent/mymoves/_index.md) that looks like the following:<br>---
name: My Awesome Moves
summary: A set of really awesome custom moves I made for my campaign
---
<br>Any frontmatter properties in that file will be directly added to the Datasworn Source collection object generated for the folder.<br>Instead of an _index.md file, you may use an _index.yaml file. Any top-level fields will be merged into the collection object.<br><br>To make it easier to create Oracles, Iron Vault supports a straightforward Markdown format for creating oracles. Here's an example Oracle Markdown file:<br>---
type: oracle_rollable
description: Here is a description of my oracle.
---

| dice: 1d6 | Result                                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2       | [Action](oracle_rollable:sundered_isles/core/action) |
| 3-5       | [Theme](oracle_rollable:sundered_isles/core/theme)   |
| 6         | Just foo                                             |
<br>Frontmatter:<br>
<br>The type frontmatter property must say oracle_rollable. That's how Iron Vault knows you want this to be parsed as an Oracle file.
<br>All other frontmatter properties will be added to the Datasworn Source OracleRollable object as-is.
<br>By default, the name will be the name of the file; you may override this by providing a name property in the frontmatter.
<br>The oracle itself is provided in table format. The first column indicates the dice to roll (in this case, 1d6), and the second column is the result. Dice rolls can be provided either as a range (3-5) or a single value (6). Iron Vault does not currently validate that the values cover the entire range or are non-overlapping, and behavior in either case is unspecified.<br>As shown in the example, your results may embed references to other oracles. These will be embedded as subrolls when the Oracle is used. Among other things, this can be used to create templates (such as for faction names), where a result is composed of several other rolls.<br>You can also combine multiple dice as though they were "digits" by separating the digits in the dice and range expressions with a semi colon. For example, to roll what is sometimes called a "d66" table, you can use a table like this:<br>| dice: 1d6;1d6 | Result |
| ------------- | ------ |
| 1;1-2         | A      |
| 1;3-6         | B      |
| 2;1-3         | C      |
| 2;4-6         | D      |
| 3-6;1         | E      |
| 3-6;4-6       | F      |
<br>Iron Vault will convert this to a d36 table with the appropriate rows. Note that&nbsp;3-6;1&nbsp;will "flatten" to non-contiguous values (13,&nbsp;19,&nbsp;25,&nbsp;31), and those rows will be repeated in the flattened oracle table.<br><br>To make it easier to create Assets, Iron Vault supports a straightforward Markdown format for creating Assets. Here's an example Asset Markdown file:<br>---
type: asset
---

# Asset name (Asset path)

Once you write an asset... (this optional paragraph becomes the "requirement")

## Abilities

* [x] This is a default checked ability.
* [ ] This is a default unchecked ability.
* [ ] Right now abilities aren't parsed for anything (so, e.g., you can't currently embed custom asset moves)

## Controls

* health (condition meter, max: 3)
  * weakened (checkbox, is_impact: true)

## Options

* pen name (text)
<br>Frontmatter:<br>
<br>The type frontmatter property must say asset. That's how Iron Vault knows you want this to be parsed as an Asset file.
<br>All other frontmatter properties will be added to the Datasworn Source Asset object as-is.
<br>The Abilities section is mandatory; however you may omit the ## Abililties header if you'd like.<br>The Controls and Options sections are optional and can appear in any order, as long as they are after the mandatory Abilities section.<br><br>The Iron Vault Homebrew Inspector sidebar tab shows you a list of all of the files detected in the currently selected custom source folder. Files with errors are displayed with an "error" label. If you click on the file, you can see the errors <br>Homebrew inspector is an early release.
The error messages are not currently very friendly-- they are the raw output of the Datasworn compiler and its JSON Schema validation. We will try to improve the user-friendliness of these messages over time.

 <br>Iron Vault supports multiple characters per vault, which means it's possible to play multiplayer campaigns. Each player can have a different "active" character, and their actions will be based around that character.<br>In order to play with multiple players, you will also need some method of synchronizing your vault across multiple machines. Currently, none of the available alternatives support showing cursors of other players, or true realtime sync. There's always a slight delay.

It's a paid product, and all the players would need an active account in order to play. Subscriptions start at $4-$5/mo for one "hosted" vault per player (that is, one of each player can host a different campaign, since inviting others to your vault doesn't count against your limit), or $8-$10 for 10 vaults per player.<br>While it's a paid product, Obsidian Sync is the easiest to get working across platforms, and the most effective and fastest at synchronization.<br>Sharing a single Obsidian Sync account between all players and splitting the costs (or having one person shoulder them) is against Obsidian's terms of service, which prohibit account sharing.<br>It is likely Obsidian Sync will eventually support multiple cursors and more realtime document editing like in Google Docs.

 <br>New releases of Iron Vault may change how it represents different information present in your vault. The two main reasons for this are:<br>
<br>Internal changes to how Iron Vault represents things: For example, if we changed how we store the data on your character sheet
<br>Changes to the version of Datasworn used by Iron Vault: As discussed in <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rulesets and Homebrew</a>, Iron Vault relies on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> for both the internal representation of Ironsworn components and for the underlying data itself. This means that when major changes occur in Datasworn, your vault may need to be updated. In particular, if Datasworn changes the IDs for existing content, those ID references in your character sheet, journals, and more will need to be updated.
<br>Whenever you open a vault with Iron Vault installed, Iron Vault will check your vault to determine if any migrations are needed. You can also trigger this check by running the "Check if vault data migration is needed" command.<br>Unmigrated vaults
Iron Vault is only designed to work with vaults compatible with the current release. Using Iron Vault commands on an unmigrated vault may have unpredictable results.
<br><br>When Iron Vault detects that your vault needs a migration, you will be prompted to generate a migration report:<br><img alt="Migration report prompt.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/migration-report-prompt.png" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>If you choose yes, the plugin will generate a preview <a data-href="#Migration report" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Migration_report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Migration report</a> which you can use to understand the changes it will make in your vault. If you are satisfied with the report, run the "Check if vault data migration is needed" command again and this time choose "no" for the report.<br>If you choose no, you will then see a new prompt, asking you if you wish to allow the migration:<br><img alt="Migration prompt.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/migration-prompt.png" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Back up your vault before attempting migration
You should make a back up of your vault before running a migration. We design the migrations carefully and test them before release, but, because they can rewrite all files in your vault, you should keep a backup to guard against a migration causing data loss.
<br>If you choose "yes", your vault will be migrated to the latest version. A <a data-href="#Migration report" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Migration_report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Migration report</a> will be generated so you can see what changes were actually made to your vault.<br><br>Migration reports detail the changes made (or, in the case of previews, the changes that would be made) in a migration. You can review a preview log before <br>
<img alt="Migration report.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/migration-report.png" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;">

 <br>Now that we have a character, the next step is to create our first sector. You can find the process for this on p. 114 of the Starforged Rulebook.<br>Generating your starting sector is a 10-step process, so expect it to take a while, and remember that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="01 - Initial Setup > Prep is Play" data-href="01 - Initial Setup#Prep is Play" href="https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/01-initial-setup.html#Prep_is_Play" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prep is Play</a>!<br>Before we start, it's worth noting that this part of the guide involves a lot of suggestions on how to represent your sector and things in it. Remember that you're free to structure your campaign however you want! Obsidian is a very flexible tool. In the interest of not getting too deep in the weeds with what's out there, though, we've documented a "happy path" that you can get started with and transform into what's most ideal for you. See the <a data-href="Sectors" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/sectors.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sectors</a> documentation for other ideas.<br><br>This guide will go over the following steps of sector generation:<br>

<br><a data-href="#Next steps" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Next_steps" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Next steps</a>
<br><br>For this example, we're going to use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md/canvas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://obsidian.md/canvas" target="_blank">Obsidian Canvas</a> to represent regions. It's a very flexible tool that gives us all of the pieces we need to have an interesting and visually-appealing region that we can link to!<br>We start by running the "Create a canvas" command, or by clicking on the "Create new canvas" Ribbon button.<br>We also move that canvas into a "Locations/Sectors" folder in our vault, to keep things organized.<br>Don't worry about giving it a name for now: that's our last step!<br><img alt="sector-initial.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/sector-initial.png"><br>Once that's done, we can complete Step 1 by adding a new card to our Canvas that we'll use for basic sector details. You can turn this into a note later if you'd like, too.<br>Go ahead and make a card using the Canvas interface, then pick which region to start in. Iron Vault also includes an unofficial Region oracle that you can find under "Homebrew" in the sidebar, if you're having trouble deciding.<br><img alt="sector-region.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/sector-region.png"><br>Let's move on.<br><br>Once that's done, this step is simple: make note of how many settlements we'll need to generate based on what you picked for your starting region. The Rulebook gives the following suggestions, based on your sector's region:<br>
<br>Terminus: 4 settlements
<br>Outlands: 3 settlements
<br>Expands: 2 settlements
<br><br>Now it's time to generate the settlements themselves! For this, we switch back to our Session 0 journal, because we'll be rolling some oracles!<br>Iron Vault lets you roll multiple oracles at the same time by going to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar's Oracle Tab</a> and pressing the dice icon on any oracle group. Some of these oracle groups, though, have special semantics, and we call those rollable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/index" data-href="Entities/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Entities</a>.<br>Generating an entity is easy: run the <a data-href="Generate an entity" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/generate-an-entity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Generate an entity</a> command, or click on the corresponding dice icon in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar</a> for the entity you want to roll. You'll see a list of supported entities pop up in a list. In our case, we want to generate a Settlement, so we pick that entity.<br><img alt="entity-type-picker.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/entity-type-picker.png"><br>The next prompt will ask you what region you want to generate this in, which you can optionally roll.<br><img alt="entity-region-picker.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/entity-region-picker.png"><br>Then, you'll get a popup that looks like this:<br><img alt="generate-entity-modal.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/generate-entity-modal.png"><br>This includes all oracles related to this entity that you might want to roll. The Rulebook, however, specifies only a subset of them for initial generation. We can roll only those oracles by clicking "Roll First Look":<br><img alt="generate-entity-modal-filled.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/generate-entity-modal-filled.png"><br>Make sure you have the Session 0 note open, then toggle on the "Create entity file" setting, and click accept. You'll end up with a new note in your vault, and a bunch of oracle rolls recorded in your Session 0 note, for future reference. While you're at it, move your new settlement into a "Locations/Settlements" folder in your vault:<br><img alt="first-settlement.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/first-settlement.png"><br>Go ahead and do this for the rest of the settlements you're supposed to generate, up to the recommended number, then we can move on.<br><br>Planets are also entities, so we can repeat this process for any settlements that are either planetside, or in orbit of a planet. This time, we'll move them to a "Locations/Planets" folder:<br><img alt="generated-planets.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/generated-planets.png"><br>If you don't like a name, or if you want to manually edit one of the generated fields, you can go ahead and edit the note for the planet itself (you can do this for settlements, too, of course).<br>The last step with planets is to associate them with the settlements we generated them for. This is a two step process: add a link from the planet to the settlement, then another from the settlement to the planet, for convenience. This part is optional but can be helpful!<br>To add these links, just open up your settlement and click on the right-hand column next to location, then type ([[NameOfPlanet]]) next to where the location is, and a link will be created, like so:<br><img alt="edited-settlement-planet.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/edited-settlement-planet.png"><br>And then we do the inverse in the Planet note:<br><img alt="edited-planet-settlement.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/edited-planet-settlement.png"><br>Repeat this for all your planet/settlement pairs, and we're done with this step!<br><br>This step is optional, but we may as well look at how to do it here, too. Generating a star doesn't even require entity generation: it's a simple oracle roll on the Stellar Object oracle:<br><img alt="stellar-object-oracle-rolls.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/stellar-object-oracle-rolls.png"><br>If you want, you can either create new notes for these and hash them out some more, give them names, etc. Or, if you want to keep it simple, just add a row to your planets' notes with the results of the oracle:<br><img alt="planet-with-star-row.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/planet-with-star-row.png"><br><br>Now that we have all our bits together, it's time to set up our sector map in more detail!<br>Go back to your sector Canvas from before. Then, add a new note to the Canvas with all of your elements and arrange them how you'd like. I like putting planets and settlements in a Canvas Group named after either the planet or the star so I can drag them around together while having them both right on the map:<br><img alt="sector-with-stuff.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/sector-with-stuff.png"><br>There's a lot more you could do here to gussy it up, but as the Rulebook says, I like to keep it simple. I can make it fancier later!<br>For a more in-depth guide to working with the Canvas, see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas" target="_blank">its official documentation</a>.<br><br>Now that we have things on our map, let's connect them!<br>Obsidian Canvas supports connecting nodes with edges, just like what we need to do our passages! To create an edge, first hover over one of the sides of your nodes. You'll see a small circle pop up right in the middle. If you grab this circle, you can drag a line all the way to another node or node group, and it will connect them! I like to also change the arrow type to "nondirectional", and give them a color. Sometimes I color code them based on what kind of journey it is, but that's up to you.<br><img alt="sector-with-passages.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/sector-with-passages.png"><br><br>Once you have everything set up, it's time to pick one settlement you'd like to zoom into. First, we'll go back to our section for settlements and add a new sub-header: #### Zooming in: [[NameOfSettlement]]Then, we'll use the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ask the Oracle</a> command, or search in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar</a> for "settlement oracles".<br>The Rulebook suggests we roll the following, so we'll do that:<br>
<br>First Look (1-2 times)
<br>Settlement Trouble
<br>Once you have those in your Session 0 journal, you can simply copy/paste them to the corresponding table for your settlement in that settlement's note!<br><img alt="zoomed-in-settlement.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/zoomed-in-settlement.png"><br><br>For this, we don't have to <a data-href="Make a move" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/make-a-move.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Make a move</a>, since we're supposed to assume an automatic strong hit, so we'll just do the next step: <a data-href="Generate an entity" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/generate-an-entity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Generate an entity</a> and picking "Character". Following the same process as with Planets and Settlements, make sure you've checked "Create entity file". For this, you might also want to click on the dice icon to roll for a Character Role, and then click Accept.<br>For NPCs, I like to make an "NPCs" folder in my vault, then I can move my new connection in there:<br><img alt="generated-connection.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/generated-connection.png"><br>We're not quite done, though: a Connection is a type of progress track. Going back to our Session 0 journal, we run the <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Create a progress track</a> command and fill it out, then press "Create":<br><img alt="new-progress-trap-modal.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/new-progress-trap-modal.png"><br>Finally, we go to the NPC note and, under the roll results table, we add an embedded link to our new progress track: ![[Name of Connection Track|iv-embed]]. You'll end up with something like this:<br><img alt="embedded-connection-track.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/embedded-connection-track.png"><br>The |iv-embed part is optional, but it makes it so the usual embed decorations from Obsidian don't show up, making it look more like it's more part of the page.<br>At this point, you can do the rest of the connection creation by going back to Session 0 and rolling the rest of the recommended character oracles:<br>
<br>First Look (1-2 times)
<br>Character Goal
<br>Revealed Character Aspect (1-2 times)
<br>And add them to the NPC's results table just like we did with the zoomed-in settlement.<br>Finally, add another row to your NPC's table called "Location", and link the settlement you'd like to put them in, to wrap up your first connection:<br><img alt="completed-connection.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/completed-connection.png"><br><br>Going back to our Session 0 journal, we put our cursor under our "Starting Sector" header (or wherever you want oracle results to show up), and we go ahead and roll on the Sector Trouble table: <br><img alt="sector-trouble.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/sector-trouble.png"><br><br>To finish up, we either come up with or roll the Sector Name oracle, then we go back to our Sector map and add both the Sector Trouble and the Sector Name to that sector information card we made earlier, which only has the Region in it so far:<br><img alt="finalized-sector.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/finalized-sector.png"><br>If you want, you can do what I did and make the card's contents into a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables" target="_blank">Markdown table</a> to make it look nicer.<br>Finally, go ahead and rename your Sector Canvas file to the name you ended up with, so it's not just "Untitled".<br><br>And with that, we've completed the entire Starting Sector guide! Following along with the Starforged Rulebook, that means you're ready to <a data-href="06 - Begin Your Adventure" href="https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/06-begin-your-adventure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">06 - Begin Your Adventure</a> and see what it's like to get into the rest of gameplay using Iron Vault!]]></description><link>https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/05-build-a-starting-sector.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Player's Guide/Getting Started/05 - Build a Starting Sector.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 19:41:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/sector-initial.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/sector-initial.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[04 - Create Your Character]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Your character! Your character is the protagonist of your story. They are the vehicle through which you write and experience the story you're telling by playing these wonderful games.<br>As such, the process of creating your character is very important! In this guide, we'll walk you through the whole process, following along with the Starforged Rulebook's steps!<br><br>What's a hero without a character sheet?<br>Iron Vault has a concept of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://ironvault.quest/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Character Entities</a>, and includes built-in <a data-href="Character Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/character-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Character Blocks</a>. With these two building blocks, we can build a full-featured, flexible character sheet!<br>You can quickly generate a character sheet by running the <a data-href="Create new character" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/create-new-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Create new character</a> command (either through the Ribbon button or through Ctrl+P/Cmd+P). This will prompt you for a character name, but don't worry: you can fill this in later, you might just have to rename the file if that happens.<br>The first thing you'll notice, of course, is a long column of words and numbers and such on the top of the page:<br><img alt="character-frontmatter.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/character-frontmatter.png"><br>These are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties" target="_blank">Obsidian Properties</a>, otherwise referred to as the Frontmatter. In essence, this is where the "data" for your character is stored. The first thing you'll probably want to do is get it out of the way, though, so just click on "Properties" to collapse it.<br>Once you do that, you'll be greeted with a much nicer representation of that data, your character sheet, as rendered by <a data-href="Character Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/character-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Character Blocks</a>:<br><img alt="character-sheet.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/character-sheet.png"><br>This character sheet is fully-editable and interactive, so you never have to manually edit Properties yourself, even if that's what it ends up writing to each time.<br><br>There's eleven steps for character creation in Starforged, and we'll be going over each one!<br>

<br><br>Assuming you haven't already been playing around with the shiny character sheet, this is your first interaction with it! Let's make it count.<br>The first step after sorting cards (which we don't have to do) is to pick two Path assets. We can do that one of two ways:<br>
<br>Run the <a data-href="Add asset to character" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/add-asset-to-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Add asset to character</a> command
<br>Clock on the "Add Asset" button at the bottom of your character sheet
<br>Whichever you choose, you'll be greeted by this popup window:<br><img alt="asset-picker-initial.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/asset-picker-initial.png"><br>
You can click on each asset category here to expand it. For example, we only care about Paths right now:<br><img alt="asset-picker-expanded.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/asset-picker-expanded.png"><br>Finally, you can expand again in order to see a nicely-rendered asset card for each asset, as well as a button that you can press to add it. You'll be able to edit the asset's fields after you add it:<br><img alt="asset-picker-card.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/asset-picker-card.png"><br>Go ahead and pick your two Paths. If you change your mind about a choice, simply click the "x" button on the asset card in your character sheet. If you want to reorder them, just drag and drop them by the top part.<br><br>Although you had some opportunity to do this with Truths, this is likely the first time you'll have to make a choice about where to put something and how to organize your vault. Your backstory can go anywhere you want, after all!<br>Some ideas:<br>
<br>Write it under a ## Backstory section at the bottom of your character sheet.
<br>Use the Session 0 note to start fleshing out a bit of background narrative and make it more story-like.
<br>Create a separate note, maybe in a separate folder like "Lore", where you can add snippets of backstory like this.
<br>Or anything else you can think up! As long as you write it somewhere in the vault, you'll be able to keep track of it and link to it pretty freely! I recommend making sure you put a header (##...) of some sort at the start of your backstory, though, to make it easier to link directly to it.<br>Want some help? You can <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ask the Oracle</a>! You can do this two ways:<br>
<br>Run the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ask the Oracle</a> command directly through the Command Palette/Ribbon button
<br>Use the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Iron Vault Sidebar Oracle Browser</a>
<br><br>As before, you can simply run the command, and you'll be greeted by a filterable oracle picker. Search for "Backstory Prompts" to find the table we're looking for, and select it. <br><br>Regardless of which method you pick, you'll be greeted with this popup window:<br><img alt="backstory-prompts-popup.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/backstory-prompts-popup.png"><br>
The roll will have been made immediately, but you can choose to reroll by clicking on the reroll icon, or select either the current roll, or the flipped (opposite) roll.<br>In my case, I decided to put my backstory details in my "Session 0" journal, so that's what I had open when I called this:<br><img alt="backstory-mechanics-block.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/backstory-mechanics-block.png"><br>
What's this? Well, that's a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oracle Mechanics Block</a>. Iron Vault includes all sorts of mechanics blocks for all sorts of situations having to do with game mechanics, and it renders them all nicely for you! If you're curious, you can go ahead and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks" data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">read more about them here.</a> As you can see, I also wrote some extra color underneath to set the stage for the backstory in a more narrative way.<br><br>Next up: your background vow! We'll be creating our first progress track this time.<br>I'll start by rolling on the Character Goal Oracle to get an idea of what that might be. Then, I'll use the <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Create a progress track</a> command to create the vow itself.<br>Skipping over the Oracle roll, this is what the progress track popup window will look like:<br><img alt="background-vow-window.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/background-vow-window.png"><br>I've already filled in the fields with what makes sense for our particular vow, and when I press create, the following will be inserted into my Session 0 note:<br><img alt="background-vow-inserted.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/background-vow-inserted.png"><br><br>You're likely getting a sense of how to do things by now. Our next step is to set up our Starship. Let's start with an Oracle roll. In this case, I'll go click on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sidebar > Oracle Tab" data-href="Sidebar#Oracle Tab" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/sidebar.html#Oracle_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidebar's Oracle Tab</a> and search for "starship". Browsing around. I see that this Oracle is actually under "Campaign Launch Oracles":<br><img alt="sidebar-starship-history.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/sidebar-starship-history.png"><br>After rolling that, I can once again <a data-href="Add asset to character" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/add-asset-to-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Add asset to character</a> (or click on the "Add Asset" button on my character sheet), and pick the Starship from the list, making sure to give it a name!<br><img alt="starship-asset.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/starship-asset.png"><br><br>And just like above, we repeat that for our final asset. This time, you can pick anything except a Deed! So go ahead and do that.<br><br>You may have noticed that all your stats on your character sheet were actually set to "0". In this step, we'll go ahead and set them to what we want.<br>The standard spread for stats in Starforged and Ironsworn is 3 2 2 1 1. So we'll allocate those by just... clicking on each stat box and typing them in!<br><img alt="stats-edited.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/stats-edited.png"><br><br>Iron Vault will have already set your condition meters to their defaults, but if you want to make any adjustments, you can either click on the +/- buttons next to each value, or type the value you want by clicking on the numbers themselves.<br>Momentum reset will automatically be tracked for you based on your impacts.<br><img alt="condition-meters.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/condition-meters.png"><br><br>Let's picture in our minds what our character is like! This can really immerse you in your new character, and also give you clues about how they see the world and how the world sees them.<br>The Starforged Rulebook suggests defining one or two facts about how they look, how they act, and what they wear.<br>We have some options on where to put this, such as the bottom of the character sheet or in Session 0, but for this basic description, we'll just type these details in the "description" box in the character sheet itself:<br><img alt="character-description.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/character-description.png"><br><br>While we already named our character when we first created them, it's time to give them a callsign and some pronouns. We can, again, just fill these in directly on the character sheet, rolling an oracle for the callsign if we want (while on the Session 0 note):<br><img alt="callsign-pronouns.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/callsign-pronouns.png"><br><br>Our last step is to gear up!<br>The base assumption is that we all have a spacer kit with some basics in it. But we can also add a section to our character sheet with details about some other stuff we might be carrying around. For this, we can go to the bottom of our character sheet and just add another header:<br><img alt="gearing-up.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/gearing-up.png"><br><br>That was a lot!<br>But with all that done: congratulations! You've made your first character using Iron Vault!<br>Now we can move on to <a data-href="05 - Build a Starting Sector" href="https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/05-build-a-starting-sector.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">05 - Build a Starting Sector</a>.]]></description><link>https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/04-create-your-character.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Player's Guide/Getting Started/04 - Create Your Character.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 19:41:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/character-frontmatter.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/character-frontmatter.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[03 - Choose Your Truths]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>The first step in any Ironsworn or Starforged campaign is to Choose Your Truths. These are facts about your world that help set the stage for the space you'll be playing in. Each <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Rulesets and Homebrew" data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ruleset</a> comes with its own set of Truths, which are themed to that game or expansion's default setting. Of course, you can always skip right by this and start writing about your world however you prefer, but using the Truths tool is very handy!<br><br>Iron Vault directly supports tools through something called <a data-href="Truth Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/truth-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Truth Blocks</a>. These are also the first type of block you'll be introduced to.<br>Iron Vault uses <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Blocks/index" data-href="Blocks/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blocks</a> for many things, in order to draw special tools and interactive widgets on your notes for you that will help you during play.<br>All Blocks are created the same way: three backticks, a block name, a new line, and three more backticks. Sometimes, there can be something between the backticks. For example, this is what a Truth Block for the Cataclysm Truth looks like:<br>```iron-vault-truth
Cataclysm
```
<br>When used in a note, it will render a widget that looks like this, and which you can click on to interact with:<br>
          This file is not part of a campaign, but a campaign is needed for a
          truths block.
        <br>Having to write all these out can get tedious, though, so Iron Vault generally has commands or buttons that will generate them for you.<br><br>In our case, what we want is the <a data-href="Generate Truths" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/generate-truths.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Generate Truths</a> command. You can run it by either clicking on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="" target="_blank">Obsidian Ribbon</a> icon that looks like:  <img alt="ribbon-icon.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/ribbon-icon.png" style="width: 40px; max-width: 100%;">, then choosing "Generate Truths" from the menu that pops up. You can also use Ctrl+P (or Cmd+P on macOS) to open the Obsidian Command Palette and search for the "Generate Truths" command there.<br>When you call it, you'll get a menu like this:<br><img alt="generate-truths-menu.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/generate-truths-menu.png"><br>Go ahead and set the file name to "Truths" and leave Target Folder blank, then press "Create".<br>Iron Vault will then create a Truths file and prepopulate it with headers and <a data-href="Truth Blocks" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/truth-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Truth Blocks</a> for all of Starforge's default Truths. It'll look something like this:<br><img alt="generated-truths-page.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/generated-truths-page.png"><br>Now we can start picking our Truths!<br><br>At this point, you can go one by one and select your Truths.<br>The Starforged Rulebook gives you three options for choosing each Truth:<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Just choosing a Truth" data-href="#Just choosing a Truth" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Just_choosing_a_Truth" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Just choosing a Truth from the list</a>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Rolling for a Truth" data-href="#Rolling for a Truth" href="https://ironvault.quest/about:blank#Rolling_for_a_Truth" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling for a Truth using your oracle dice</a>

<br>Iron Vault supports all three!<br>Once you've taken your chosen path, you'll be able to move on to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="04 - Create Your Character" data-href="04 - Create Your Character" href="https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/04-create-your-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creating Your Character</a>.<br><br>Directly choosing a Truth is as simple as clicking on the Select your truth... dropdown in each Truth Block, and picking whichever you like best. You may need to repeat it if the Truth has sub-options.<br>When you're satisfied with your choice, press the save button on the bottom right to write the results to your note.<br><br>To randomize this process, you can click on the small die button next to the Select your truth... dropdown. This will pick a random Truth from the list of built-in ones. You may have to repeat this if the Truth has sub-options.<br>If you're satisfied with the results, press the save button on the bottom right to write the results to your note.<br><br>Truth notes are regular notes! You can actually write anything you want on this note, in any structure you want. If you want to reorder the Truths, you can just cut and paste the header and the Truth Block and move it wherever you want. Likewise, if you want to add or remove Truths, you can do that, although Truth Blocks will only work for Truths in your active <a data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rulesets and Homebrew</a>. But headers still work!<br>If you chose to pick or roll for a Truth, as above, you can also freely edit the results at any time to add more color, to change details, or otherwise update the Truth to your preference.<br>Eventually, you may even want to move your Truths into different notes, and all you have to do for that is to cut and paste the parts you want.<br><br>Did you press save, but you don't like the results and you want to try again? Just press the "Reset" button on the Truth Block, and it'll insert a separator before your current Truth text, and let you pick your Truth again!<br><br>Once you've taken your chosen path, you'll be able to move on to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="04 - Create Your Character" data-href="04 - Create Your Character" href="https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/04-create-your-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creating Your Character</a>.]]></description><link>https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/03-choose-your-truths.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Player's Guide/Getting Started/03 - Choose Your Truths.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 19:41:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/ribbon-icon.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/ribbon-icon.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[02 - Your First Campaign]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>As part of this guide, we'll walk you from initial setup of your campaign through to the end of a short combat scene. This Guide will use Starforged as an example, but you can use any supported <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Rulesets and Homebrew" data-href="Rulesets and Homebrew" href="https://ironvault.quest/other-features/rulesets-and-homebrew.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ruleset</a> in Iron Vault to play!<br><br>The process for launching your campaign starts on Chapter 2, page 74, of the Ironsworn: Starforged Rulebook.<br>As it points out very quickly: Prep is Play. Which means: Congratulations! You're already playing Starforged using Iron Vault!<br>At the end of <a data-href="01 - Initial Setup" href="https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/01-initial-setup.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01 - Initial Setup</a>, you should have seen this screen:<br><img alt="Onboarding tab.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/onboarding-tab.png" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>As the welcome message says, Iron Vault organizes vaults into <a data-href="Campaigns/index" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Campaigns/index</a>. Click on "create a campaign" (or choose the <a data-href="Creating a campaign" href="https://ironvault.quest/campaigns/creating-a-campaign.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creating a campaign</a> command from the Obsidian command selector). This will show a dialog like the following:<br><img alt="Create a new campaign modal.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/create-a-new-campaign-modal.png" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Give your name a campaign, but don't worry-- you can always change it later!<br>By default, your campaign will be created as a subfolder of your vault's root folder. This is a good option if you want to add multiple campaigns in this vault. If you wish to dedicate this vault to a single campaign, you might want to pick the vault root (type / in the folder input) as the home for your campaign. If you wish to keep multiple campaigns, you can use the default where it creates a folder with the same name as your campaign.<br>Either way, once you've created your new campaign, you are ready to begin!<br><br>Before we start, we have to introduce a core concept to Iron Vault: journals.<br>Iron Vault has a lot of features to populate and manage your story journals. Many of its commands and actions actually record their results in a journal and render them in a nice way, so you can look back and see exactly what was happening with your mechanics, or tweak things as needed.<br>Since we're going to start interacting with these mechanics commands now, you should take a moment to create a "Journals" folder in your campaign folder. Inside it, create a "Session 0" note and open it. We'll use this to record all our upcoming Ask the Oracle rolls:<br><img alt="session-0.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/session-0.png"><br>You can write anything you want here! Write about your thoughts so far on what you want out of your campaign, or what ideas you have for your character. Or just leave it blank for now, and we'll just use it as a scratch board for Oracle rolls.<br>To quickly address the first section on player safety: Iron Vault supports two safety mechanisms related to the safety strategies the Rulebook describes:<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Make a move" data-href="Make a move" href="https://ironvault.quest/commands/make-a-move.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Making a move</a> to Set a Flag, and then adding appropriate <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `-` (dash)" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`-` (dash)" href="https://ironvault.quest/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`-`_(dash)" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">comments</a> to it.

 <br><br>The Ironsworn/Starforged family of games all have some significant worldbuilding involved, and that can take up a lot of the time before your character starts your adventure.<br>For this reason, the books remind you that Prep is Play. That is, you're playing the game as soon as you engage with it, when you're starting to create the game world, when you're thinking of ideas and, in our case, when you're setting up Iron Vault and learning how to use it!<br>We hope you'll bring the Prep is Play spirit to seeing what Iron Vault can do and how it can help enrich your experience playing these wonderful games!<br><br>Being a plugin, Iron Vault requires that you first install <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank">Obsidian.md</a>, a free note-taking tool that will help you organize your campaign in just about any way you'd like!<br>To begin, you'll want to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian" target="_blank">install Obsidian</a> on your preferred platform/device.<br>Once that's done, you can <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault" target="_blank">create a vault</a> for your campaign!<br>If you'd like, you can read through the rest of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/Home#Getting+started" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Home#Getting+started" target="_blank">Obsidian Getting Started Guide</a>, but you should be able to get started with just those first two steps.<br>Once you've created your vault, you'll be greeted by a screen that looks a bit like this:<br><img alt="getting-started-initial.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/getting-started-initial.png"><br>You can go ahead and close the graph tab, then right click (or long tap) on the "Welcome" note and delete it.<br><br>The easiest way to install Iron Vault is to install it directly from the Community Plugins registry in Obsidian itself. Open Settings, then navigate to Community Plugins:<br><img alt="community-plugins.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/community-plugins.png"><br>Then click "Browse" and search for "Iron Vault":<br><img alt="iron-vault-plugin-search.png" src="https://ironvault.quest/lib/media/iron-vault-plugin-search.png"><br>Finally, click "Install", and make sure to click "Enable" once the install is complete!<br>You should see an onboarding screen similar to this one:<br>

You can even house multiple campaigns in the same vault!<br>The plugin is designed to be used piecemeal: you can use as much or as little as you want, and our only hope is that some part of it will be useful enough to make you enjoy your experience a little more.<br>It is not a "play for me"-style VTT, in the sense that while it has a lot of conveniences for rendering and interacting with mechanics, the actual resolution and logic of game mechanics is left up to you, and whatever flexibility you want to handle the game's rules with. The game, after all, is not a single monolithic set of laws, and everyone tends to take their own liberties with the rules in the interest of enjoying the game more.<br><br>To keep up with the latest releases of Iron Vault, we recommend checking the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/iron-vault-plugin/iron-vault/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/iron-vault-plugin/iron-vault/releases" target="_blank">Github Releases</a> page.
