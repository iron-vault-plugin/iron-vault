[[Campaigns/index|Campaign]] properties can be edited by right-clicking the campaign file in the file explorer and choosing "Edit campaign" from the context menu. You can also access "Edit campaign" from the "..." button in the top-right corner when you have the campaign file open in the normal editor.

For details about these settings, see [[Creating a campaign]].

Note that changing the **Display name** does *not* rename the campaign root folder or index file; it only changes the name that Iron Vault uses when displaying the campaign.
