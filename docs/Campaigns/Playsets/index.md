A playset is a defined subset of all of the [[Rulesets and Homebrew|available content from official sources and homebrew]]. Each [[Campaigns/index|campaign]] is configured to use a specific playset, and this controls what moves, assets, oracles, etc are available when that campaign is [[Campaigns/index|active]].

When [[Creating a campaign|creating]] or [[Editing a campaign|editing]] a campaign, you can choose one of the [[Built-in playsets]] or you may configure a [[Custom playsets|custom playset]].

> [!todo] Homebrew
> Currently, if you wish to enable [[Rulesets and Homebrew|homebrew]] in a campaign, you must use a custom playset. In the future, we may make it easier to include certain kinds of homebrew content in your campaign.
