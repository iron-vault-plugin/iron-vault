A playset is a defined subset of all of the [[Rulesets and Homebrew|available content from official sources and homebrew]]. Each [[Campaigns/index|campaign]] is configured to use a specific playset, and this controls what moves, assets, oracles, etc are available when that campaign is [[Campaigns/index|active]].

When [[Creating a campaign|creating]] or [[Editing a campaign|editing]] a campaign, you can choose one of the [[Built-in playsets]] or you may configure a [[Custom playsets|custom playset]].

> [!info] Homebrew
> You have two options for including [[Rulesets and Homebrew|homebrew]] in a campaign. One is to add it to your configured vault-wide Homebrew folder and then include the package in a custom playset. Use this option if you are importing Datasworn packages from third parties or are creating your own reusable package.
> 
> The other option is to use the campaign-specific custom content folder. In this case, you do not need a custom playset; the content in this folder will be compiled into a package and included automatically in your campaign.
