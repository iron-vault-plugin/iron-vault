Adds an [[Assets|Asset]] to your [[Characters|Active Character]]. The command will prompt you for an asset to add, letting you filter your choice from all available assets in your active [[Rulesets and Homebrew]].

This asset will have default settings and will appear in your character sheet, where you can then customize it as needed.
