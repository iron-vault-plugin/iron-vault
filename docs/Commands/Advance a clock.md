Advances a [[Clocks|Clock]], modifying its frontmatter, and inserts a [[Mechanics Blocks#`clock`|`clock` mechanics node]] into your active journal. Clocks which are already filled, or which are completed, cannot be advanced (and will not show up at all in the picker for the command).

If your clock has a "default odds" value other than "no roll", before the clock is advanced, you will be prompted to pick an odds for advancing the clock, with your "default odds" value preselected. Picking "certain" will advance the clock without a roll; otherwise, you can choose a different odds value as the situation warrants, or hit enter to roll with your default odds. A 1d100 roll will be made, and if the resulting value is less than or equal to the chosen odds, the clock will be advanced.

Advancing a Clock to completion will not automatically be marked as resolved. You will be asked if you wish to mark the clock as resolved. If you choose not to resolve it now, you can always resolve it as needed with the [[Resolve a clock]] command.
