Advances a [[Clocks|Clock]], modifying its frontmatter, and inserts a [[Mechanics Blocks#`clock`|`clock` mechanics node]] into your active journal. Clocks which are already filled, or which are completed, cannot be advanced (and will not show up at all in the picker for the command).

Advancing a Clock to completion will not automatically be marked as resolved. You will be asked if you wish to mark the clock as resolved. If you choose not to resolve it now, you can always resolve it as needed with the [[Resolve a clock]] command.
