Advances a [[Progress Tracks|Progress Track]], modifying its frontmatter, and inserts a [[Mechanics Blocks#`progress`|`progress` mechanic node]] into your active journal. Progress Tracks which are already filled, or which are completed, cannot be advanced (and will not show up at all in the picker for the command).
