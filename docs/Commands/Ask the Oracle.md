This command lets you pick an [[Oracles|Oracle]] to roll, and will then record the result in your active journal. When invoked through the [[Sidebar#Oracles Tab|Sidebar]], it won't prompt you for what Oracle to roll.

If you want to Ask the Oracle in order to roll an [[Entities/index|Entity]], you can use the [[Generate an entity]] command to roll its Oracle Group together, with First Look logic and such.
