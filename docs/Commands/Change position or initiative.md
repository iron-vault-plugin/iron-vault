Changes the initiative status for the active character.

When Ironsworn is enabled, this will be "Has initiative"/"No initiative"/"Out of combat".

When Starforged is enabled, this will be "In control"/"In a bad spot"/"Out of combat".

When both are enabled, it will be both with a `/` between them.

The new position will be added to the journal, and changed in the position dropdown in the character sheet.
