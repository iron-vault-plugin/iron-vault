This command is similar to [[Ask the Oracle]], except that instead of rolling a single Oracle, it pops up a window that will let you roll multiple related Oracles together to generate a new [[Entities/index|Entity]]. You can choose to roll all fields indicated as "first look" fields in the rulebook and/or you can roll individual fields. You can also choose whether to write the results into a new file representing that Entity. In any event, the rolls you choose will be logged in an [[Mechanics Blocks#oracle-group|oracle group node]] in your journal.

You can also execute this command by clicking on the button with a die icon that appears when you open a category in the [[Sidebar#Oracles Tab|Sidebar's Oracles Tab]].

Only some Entities are currently supported, with more being added over time.

## Using the entity modal

- Each attribute of the entity is shown on a new row.
	- The underlined text is the rolled result.
	- The smaller text below is the name of the attribute.
- Clicking on the rolled result (the underlined text) will open the [[Ask the Oracle]] modal, allowing you to view all options and, if desired, select another option
- The three icons next to each row are as follows:
	- "Pick from table" (list icon): same as clicking on a rolled result, this lets you choose a value from the table directly
	- "Roll" (dice icon): roll a new value for this attribute. (If an attribute supports multiple rolls, this will add a new roll, rather than replacing it.)
	- "Clear" (delete icon): delete the rolls from this row
