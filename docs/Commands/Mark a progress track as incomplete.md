Undoes completion of a [[Progress Tracks|Progress Track]], modifying its frontmatter.

This command is mainly intended for cases where you accidentally mark a progress track as complete before you have in fact completed it. Mechanically in Ironsworn, a progress track which is complete cannot be reopened; you just have to create a new track. Nevertheless, as humans, we sometimes make mistakes, and this command is there for you when you need it.
