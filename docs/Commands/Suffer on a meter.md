Reduces one of your Meters by a certain amount, then records the results in your current journal as a [[Mechanics Blocks#`meter`|`meter` mechanics node]].

This command can only be used when you've activated the [[Settings#General|Use character system Setting]], and thus requires an actual [[Characters|Active Character]] to work at all.

If you don't want to use the Character System but still want to record suffering on a meter, you can write the [[Mechanics Blocks#`meter`|`meter` mechanics node]] directly into your journal.
