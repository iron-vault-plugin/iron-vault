Iron Vault supports maintaining character sheets for your player character. This character sheet is expected to have [[#schema|certain metadata]] that, when present, unlocks various features like automatically [[Make a move|adding your stats to rolls]], [[Add asset to character|managing your assets]], and even [[Character Blocks|rendering a nice graphical character sheet]].

As long as you have the schema in frontmatter, you can put anything you want in your character file. Even the graphical character sheet is optional. The file is a normal file so you can take any notes you want. The main catch is that you can only have one character per file.

You can create a new character by using the [[Create new character]] command and then filling in the resulting character sheet.
## Active character

Iron Vault supports multiple characters per [[Campaigns/index|campaign]]. By default, most actions will use the current "active" character as the actor for, say, moves or oracles. You can switch active characters using the [[Pick active character]]. You can also enable the `Always prompt for active character` setting in [[Settings#General|General Settings]], to have Iron Vault ask you every time, though this might get noisy.

## Schema

The following schema describes the expected structure of character file frontmatter in order for Iron Vault to be able to treat it as a character. It is automatically generated by the [[Create new character]] command. It can be modified by direct interaction with a [[Character Blocks|Character Block]], or using the [[Take on a meter]], [[Suffer on a meter]], and [[Add asset to character]] commands.
