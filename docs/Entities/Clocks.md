Starforged introduced a mechanic called "clocks", which Iron Vault has direct support for. There are two main types of clock: Tension Clocks, and Campaign Clocks. Both are represented by a single "Clock" entity in Iron Vault, and it does not distinguish between them. Clocks are managed/advanced manually.

You can create a clock using the [[Create a clock]] command. To advance the clock and record the step in your journal, use the [[Advance a clock]] command. You can also click on the clock itself, but that will *not* update your journal automatically. Finally, you can [[Resolve a clock]] which will mark it as "incomplete" and remove it from the active clocks listed in [[Advance a clock]].

#### Example
![[Doomsday Device|iv-embed]]
#### Schema

The following schema describes the expected structure of clock file frontmatter in order for Iron Vault to be able to treat it as a clock. It is automatically generated by the [[Create a clock]] command, and modified by the [[Advance a clock]] command.

| Key               | Type                                                                                                         | About                                                                                                       |

| `iron-vault-kind` | text (must be "clock")                                                                                       | Marks this as a clock file.                                                                                 |
| `default-odds`    | (optional) "small chance" \| "unlikely" \| "50 50" \| "likely" \| "almost certain" \| "certain" \| "no roll" | If present, sets the default odds to advance the clock. If `"no roll"`, you will never be prompted to roll. |
