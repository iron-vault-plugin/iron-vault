Starforged introduced a mechanic called "clocks", which Iron Vault has direct support for. There are two main types of clock: Tension Clocks, and Campaign Clocks. Both are represented by a single "Clock" entity in Iron Vault, and it does not distinguish between them. Clocks are managed/advanced manually.

You can create a clock using the [[Create a clock]] command. To advance the clock and record the step in your journal, use the [[Advance a clock]] command. You can also click on the clock itself, but that will *not* update your journal automatically.

#### Example
![[Doomsday Device|iv-embed]]
#### Schema

The following schema describes the expected structure of clock file frontmatter in order for Iron Vault to be able to treat it as a clock. It is automatically generated by the [[Create a clock]] command, and modified by the [[Advance a clock]] command.

| Key             | Type                   | About                                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name            | text                   | Name of the clock, or a brief description of what it's for.        |
| segments        | number                 | Total number of segments in the clock.                             |
| progress        | number                 | Number of *filled in* segments in the clock.                       |
| tags            | tags                   | Either `complete` or `incomplete`. Completed clocks are read-only. |
| iron-vault-kind | text (must be "clock") | Marks this as a clock file.                                        |
