Tracks are a core feature of both Ironsworn and Starforged, as well as their expansions, and most related games. They involve filling a bar of 10 boxes, with each box taking 4 ticks to fill. On certain conditions, one or more ticks are added, and depending on the kind of track, different things can be done with that.

There are two main types of track in these games, and Iron Vault supports both: Progress Tracks and Special Tracks. This document only describes the former. Special Tracks are handled through the [[Characters|Character Sheet]]

Progress Tracks describe progress towards a certain goal. There are several kinds of Progress Track, such as Connections, Vows, Combat, and Scene Challenge tracks. What they have in common is that they all have something called a "rank" (ranging from "Troublesome" to "Epic"), which determines how many ticks to add on every "progress step", and they all get filled until the player does a final "Progress Move", which determines the success or failure of the event in question, and whose action value is based on the number of boxes filled.

There are two features supporting Progress Tracks in Iron Vault: the [[Create a progress track]] command, and [[Track Blocks]]. You can use the command to create a new Progress Track entity file with all the necessary metadata in its frontmatter, as well as a Track Block. You can then add any more details you want to that file.

#### Schema

The following schema describes the expected structure of Progress Track file frontmatter in order for Iron Vault to be able to treat it as a Progress Track. It is automatically generated by the [[Create a progress track]] command and modified by [[Advance a progress track]].
