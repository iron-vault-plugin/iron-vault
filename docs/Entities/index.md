Iron Vault represents various game concepts as something called "Entities". This section lists all current entities, their data models, and links to how to use them throughout the plugin.

Some Entities are "Rollable Entities", that is, they can be generated using the [[Generate an entity]] command, through oracles.

Some entities have special handling in Iron Vault. These are called *tracked entities*. *Iron Vault* requires special information in the frontmatter of these entities and implements various commands for working with them.

The tracked entities are:

* [[Campaigns]] (all other tracked entities are part of a campaign)
* [[Entities/Characters|Characters]]
* [[Clocks|Clocks]]
* [[Progress Tracks]]

The supported untracked entities are:

- [[Entities/Assets|Assets]]
- [[Creatures]]
- [[Delves]]
- [[Derelicts]]
- [[Factions]]
- [[Moves]]
- [[NPCs]]
- [[Oracles]]
- [[Planets]]
- [[Sectors]]
- [[Settlements]]
- [[Truths]]
- [[Vaults]]
