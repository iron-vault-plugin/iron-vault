(Experimental)

There's an API currently exposed through `window.IronVaultAPI`. It provides some rudimentary access to Iron Vault's `Datastore`, its `Character Tracker`, its `Progress Index`, and a couple of other things. This API is currently not stable, and it may change at any time until it's stabilized.

For now, we recommend you refer to [the API code](https://github.com/iron-vault-plugin/iron-vault/blob/main/packages/obsidian/src/api.ts) for information about what is available in the API.
