    <h2>What is a campaign?</h2>

    <p>
      A campaign is a folder with a <em>campaign index file</em> in its root.
      All tracked entities for a campaign, such as player characters, progress
      tracks, and clocks, must exist in the campaign root folder or one of its
      subfolders.

    <h1>Welcome to Iron Vault!</h1>

    <p>
      We noticed that your vault does not seem to have been used with Iron Vault
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this is your first time using Iron Vault, we encourage you to
      <a @click="${this._docLinkClickHandler.bind(this)}"
        >read the documentation</a
      >. In particular, the
      <a
        @click="${this._docLinkClickHandler.bind(this)}"

        >Getting started guide</a
      >
      will walk you through the main features of this plugin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before you can begin, you'll need to
      <a @click="${this._createCampaignClickHandler.bind(this)}"
        >create a campaign</a
      >.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>If you only plan to use this vault for a single campaign</strong
        >, create your new campaign at the root of your vault. (write the folder
        name as "/")
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>If you wish to play multiple campaigns in this vault</strong>,
        create your new campaign in a subfolder. This is the default as you pick
        a name for your campaign.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Welcome back to Iron Vault!</h1>

    <p>
      It looks like your vault is from a previous version of Iron Vault. Iron
      Vault now requires that all vaults have a campaign index file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your vault does not contain any campaign index files, and you must create
      one in order to resume your campaign. Use the
      <a @click="${this._createCampaignClickHandler.bind(this)}"
        >create a campaign</a
      >
      command to do so.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong
          >If your vault only has a single campaign and you want to keep it that
          way</strong
        >, the easiest thing to do is put a new campaign in the root folder of
        your vault (set the folder as "/"). All of your existing content will be
        detected as being part of that campaign, and you can continue as before.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong
          >If your vault contains multiple campaigns (or you wish to in the
          future)</strong
        >, you'll want to organize your vault with a folder for each campaign.
        Once the folders are created,
        <a @click="${this._createCampaignClickHandler.bind(this)}"
          >create a campaign</a
        >
        in each folder.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you decide to make this a single-campaign vault and change your mind
      later, simply move all your campaign files and folders inside a new
      folder, and your "root" campaign will be moved there.
